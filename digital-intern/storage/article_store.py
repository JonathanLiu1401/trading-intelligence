# ── DB lock / cursor-collision retry helper ─────────────────────────────────
# Three distinct transient DB errors are retried here; all are recoverable and
# every method this decorates is idempotent — the writers
# (``UPDATE … WHERE id=?``, ``INSERT OR IGNORE``, ``DELETE … WHERE``) AND the
# pure-SELECT readers (``get_unscored``, ``get_unalerted_urgent``,
# ``get_top_for_briefing``, ``count_unscored``, ``stats``, ``stats_since``,
# ``get_briefings_for_training``) — so a clean re-run is always safe:
#
#  1. ``OperationalError("database is locked")`` — even with
#     PRAGMA busy_timeout=60000, sustained writer contention from many threads
#     (e.g. during a long PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)) still surfaces it.
#  2. ``DatabaseError("another row available"/"another row pending")`` — the
#     shared ``self.conn`` is opened ``check_same_thread=False`` and used by
#     ~30 daemon threads. ``_write_lock`` serialises *writers*, but the many
#     LOCKLESS readers (get_unscored, get_unalerted_urgent,
#     get_top_for_briefing, count_unscored, stats, …) iterate a cursor on the
#     SAME connection; a reader still mid-fetch corrupts the connection's
#     statement state when a writer's ``executemany`` runs, raising this. It
#     was observed 48x in one production ``daemon.log`` window — each one
#     dropped a whole collected/Sonnet-labeled batch (urgent items then never
#     got urgency=1 → missed alerts; articles re-queued to the LLM forever).
#     ``ef7fbe4`` decorated the writers but left these named reader victims
#     undecorated, so a collision on ``get_unalerted_urgent`` still bubbled
#     to ``alert_worker``'s broad except (urgent items unfetched that 20s
#     cycle → delayed alerts) and ``stats`` still 500'd ``/api/stats``. The
#     readers are now decorated too — the colliding reader's ``.fetchall()``
#     completes well within the first backoff tick, so the retried SELECT
#     succeeds. (The remaining uncovered path is the trainer's *direct*
#     ``store.conn.execute`` in train_continuous; it is exception-swallowed
#     and retried next cycle. A future full fix is per-call connection
#     isolation, mirroring dashboard ``_ro_query``.)
#  3. ``DatabaseError("no more rows available")`` — the SAME shared-connection
#     cursor-collision class as (2): a writer's ``executemany`` resets the
#     connection's statement state while a lockless reader (``get_unscored``,
#     ``recursive_labeler``'s scan) is mid-iteration, and the corrupted
#     cursor surfaces this variant instead of "another row …". Live evidence
#     (2026-05-18 daemon.log): ``[scorer_worker] error: no more rows
#     available`` recurred ~hourly (06:05, 08:43) plus ``[recursive_labeler]``
#     08:01 — each leaked to the worker's broad ``except`` (the substring was
#     absent from this tuple) and dropped that cycle's scored batch, so
#     urgent items went un-scored → delayed BREAKING alerts: exactly the (2)
#     failure mode, on the scoring path. Same idempotent-retry remedy. It is
#     never a legitimate end-of-results signal inside these methods —
#     ``fetchall()`` returns ``[]`` on an empty result, so this string only
#     ever means the cursor-state corruption above.
#  4. ``DatabaseError("not an error")`` — the SAME shared-connection
#     cursor-collision class as (2)/(3), but it can corrupt a *writer's*
#     ``executemany`` too, not only a lockless reader. ``pysqlite`` returns
#     "not an error" as the ``SQLITE_OK`` (errno 0) default message when the
#     connection's statement state was reset out from under the in-flight
#     call by a concurrent writer on the SAME shared ``self.conn`` — there is
#     no other sqlite message that contains this exact substring. Live
#     evidence (2026-05-18 daemon.log): ``[recursive_labeler] error: not an
#     error`` at 12:09:20Z landed exactly at the onset of a ``database is
#     locked`` writer-contention storm (insert_batch/update_ml_scores_batch
#     exhausting at 12:09:24-32Z). It surfaced from the
#     ``@_retry_on_lock``-decorated ``update_ai_scores_batch.executemany``
#     inside the recursive-labeler's round 1 (the ``round=1 candidates=500``
#     line preceded it; ``round=1 labeled=…`` was never logged) — the
#     substring was absent from THIS tuple so the decorator re-raised instead
#     of retrying the idempotent ``UPDATE … WHERE id=?``, bubbling to the
#     worker's broad ``except`` and aborting the entire 4h Sonnet/Opus
#     gold-label cycle (every remaining batch's labels discarded). The
#     recursive_labeler had ZERO successful runs since the 07:29Z daemon
#     start (08:01 "no more rows available" pre-(3)-fix on a stale daemon,
#     12:09 "not an error" — a HEAD bug until this entry). Same
#     idempotent-retry remedy; safe by construction (every decorated op is
#     idempotent and only the errno-0 default carries this string).
#
# Retry with exponential backoff + jitter to avoid thundering-herd retries
# that would just collide again at the same instant. Bubble up after the
# budget is spent. The substring filter keeps this tight — other
# ``DatabaseError`` flavors (e.g. ``IntegrityError`` "UNIQUE constraint
# failed") must still propagate, never be silently swallowed.

    It is the SAME shared-``self.conn`` cursor-collision documented at length
    on ``_retry_on_lock`` (a concurrent writer's ``executemany`` resets the
    connection's statement state while this lockless reader is mid-fetch),
    just surfacing as a corrupted ``fetchone()`` that returns ``None`` instead
    of raising the ``another row available`` / ``no more rows available``
    ``DatabaseError`` variant. The caller does ``.fetchone()[0]``, so a ``None``
    became ``TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`` — which is NOT
    a ``sqlite3.DatabaseError``, so ``_retry_on_lock`` never caught it and it
    bubbled to the worker's broad ``except`` EVERY contended cycle. Live
    evidence (2026-05-18 daemon.log): ``[stats_worker] error: 'NoneType'
    object is not subscriptable`` recurred 12+×/h, exactly correlated with the
    concurrent ``database is locked`` writer-contention storm.

    Re-raise it as the same retryable signal the decorator already handles for
    the ``DatabaseError`` flavour of this identical collision, so the
    ``@_retry_on_lock``-decorated idempotent reader simply retries and the
    next attempt — past the writer's ``executemany`` — succeeds. Safe by
    construction: every call site is a ``MAX``/``COUNT`` aggregate, which
    SQLite ALWAYS returns one row for, so this can never mask a real empty
    result (mirrors the ``_retry_on_lock`` rationale: this only ever means
    cursor-state corruption).

    Empty-tuple guard: cursor-state corruption can ALSO surface as
    ``fetchone()`` returning ``()`` instead of ``None`` (or the documented
    ``DatabaseError`` variants). The caller's ``[0]`` then raises
    ``IndexError: tuple index out of range`` — also NOT a
    ``sqlite3.DatabaseError``, so ``_retry_on_lock`` never catches it and it
    bubbles to the worker's broad ``except`` exactly like the ``None`` case
    did before the 2026-05-18 fix. Live evidence (2026-05-19/20 daemon.log):
    ``[stats_worker] error: tuple index out of range`` recurred under the
    same ``database is locked`` writer-contention storm pattern. Treating an
    empty tuple identically to ``None`` is safe: every aggregate call site
    yields a 1-column row, so ``len(row) == 0`` is also a corruption signal
    that can never be a legitimate result."""

        ``ml_score IS NULL`` excludes articles the model has already scored
        with confidence. Without this, every 30s scorer cycle re-fetched the
        full ML-scored backlog and re-ran inference on it, while the LLM
        retry path (which writes ai_score, not ml_score) still works: a
        Sonnet-failed article keeps both ai_score=0 and ml_score=NULL, so it
        gets re-routed on the next cycle.

        ``published`` and ``first_seen`` are returned (not just id/title/body)
        because two downstream consumers need the article's age:

          - ``ml/features.py::extract_features`` derives 5 temporal features
            (hour/dow cyclic encodings, days_since_published) from
            ``published``. ``_fetch_training_data`` passes the real value at
            train time; if inference omits it the parser falls back to
            ``now()`` and those 5 features become a constant — a silent
            train/serve skew on every scored article.
          - ``watchers/urgency_scorer.score_batch`` derives each article's
            ``age_hours`` via ``_article_age_hours`` (reads ``published`` /
            ``first_seen``). That feeds both the Sonnet prompt's staleness

        permanently invisible to the alert worker: it can never be alerted and

        filter), so the dashboard shows phantom "urgent" items the analyst will
        never actually be pushed. Live evidence (2026-05-18): 26 rows stuck at
        ``urgency=1`` since 2026-05-13 — 5 days, never alerted.

        This is the structural counterpart to the ``alert_agent`` pass-18
        stale-drop fix (``d5918e3``), NOT a duplicate of it:

          - That fix marks *in-window* rows ``urgency=2`` (mark_alerted) — for
            a row the formatter actively *decided* not to deliver, "alerted"
            is both truthful and blocks re-fetch.
          - These rows are *aged-out* — the alert worker NEVER saw them, so
            ``urgency=2`` would be a lie (no analyst was ever pushed) AND
            would keep inflating the ``urgency>=1`` tile this method exists to
            fix. ``urgency=0`` is the only state that is both honest and
            corrective. The two fixes must NOT be "harmonized".

        Demotion loses zero delivery: a row older than the 24h window is
        provably never returned by ``get_unalerted_urgent`` again, so it could
        never have fired regardless (identical reasoning to pass-18's "a stale
        row only ages further — it can never become a valid fresh alert").

        Invariants: only ``urgency`` is written — ``ai_score`` / ``ml_score``
        / ``score_source`` are untouched (label/score-source separation
        intact). ``_LIVE_ONLY_CLAUSE`` is applied as defense-in-depth (same
        discipline as ``update_scores_from_labels``): synthetic rows are
        inserted ``urgency=0`` by construction so the clause is a no-op here,
        but it guarantees a future invariant violation elsewhere can't make

        Sibling to ``urgency_label_split`` (aggregate — the calibration
        headline) and ``urgency_label_split_by_source`` (per-collector
        slice — "which feeders to prune?"). Per-ticker is the third
        natural slice for the analyst persona "I depend on these alerts

        answers "is the alert path LLM-vetted?"; the per-source slice
        answers "which feeders produce the unverified noise?"; this
        answers "which of my OPEN POSITIONS are getting good vs bad
        urgent vetting?". Live evidence (2026-05-21, 24h): NVDA had 89
        urgent rows at 25% LLM-vetted (67 ML-only); AXTI had 10 urgent
        rows at 60% LLM-vetted — the biggest held name has the worst
        verification rate, a per-position answer no other metric
        surfaces.

        Mirrors ``ticker_mention_velocity``'s discipline: tickers are
        passed in (single source of truth lives at the caller —
        ``ml.features.LIVE_PORTFOLIO_TICKERS`` / ``daemon.PORTFOLIO_TICKERS``),
        avoiding the storage→ml import cycle and keeping the held-book
        definition outside the storage layer. Matching is whole-word and
        ALL-CAPS so a substring like ``NVDAQ`` cannot leak a hit for
        ``NVDA``. A leading ``$`` is allowed (``$NVDA`` matches ``NVDA``).
        Tickers shorter than 2 chars are skipped (no signal, would
        over-match). Match surface is ``title + summary`` — same surface
        as ``_book_tickers`` in alert_agent.py so the alert path and this
        metric never disagree about whether a row touches a held name.

        Returns one row per requested ticker that contributed at least
        one urgent article in the window (a ticker with zero urgent
        mentions is omitted — the analyst wants signal, not zero-rows
        for the entire book):

          * ``ticker``         — preserved verbatim from the input
          * ``total``          — urgent rows mentioning this ticker
          * ``llm``            — tagged ``score_source='llm'``
          * ``ml``             — tagged ``score_source='ml'``
          * ``briefing_boost`` — tagged ``score_source='briefing_boost'``
          * ``null``           — legacy / pre-migration rows with no tag
          * ``llm_fraction``   — ``(llm + briefing_boost) / total``

        Rows are sorted most-ml-only-first (``ml`` desc) so the worst-
        vetted held name surfaces at the top; ALPHABETICAL by ticker for
        ties (matches ``urgency_label_split_by_source``'s deterministic
        tiebreak). ``total_urgent`` and ``total_tickers`` come from rows
        actually returned (matched ≥1 ticker), so a UI can render
        "showing N of M held names".

        Read-only (single SELECT) with ``_LIVE_ONLY_CLAUSE`` so the

    ) -> dict:
        """Per-time-bucket breakdown of urgent rows by ``score_source`` — the
        TIME-AXIS sibling to ``urgency_label_split``.

        ``urgency_label_split`` reports a single point-in-time calibration
        figure (LLM-vetted fraction over the whole window). It cannot tell
        the analyst whether the rate is improving, degrading, or stable —
        critical when Sonnet quota throttles or recovers mid-window, when a
        ML-only spike (recap-template cluster, screener-tape burst) drives
        a transient hour of unverified pushes, or when the daemon was
        restarted partway through and the early buckets have no LLM yet.

        Returns one dict per ``bucket_h``-sized bucket in the requested
        window, oldest-first (so a chart renders left-to-right by time).
        Bucket boundaries are aligned to ``now - hours`` so a 24h window
        with bucket_h=4 yields exactly 6 buckets. An empty bucket (no
        urgent rows) is still emitted — same zero-data discipline as
        ``urgency_label_split`` / ``ticker_mention_velocity`` — so a
        consumer can iterate a fixed-length series without conditional
        branches and the dashboard never renders a gap.

        Each bucket dict has:

          * ``bucket_start`` — ISO timestamp of the bucket's start
                                (``first_seen >= bucket_start``)
          * ``bucket_end``   — ISO timestamp of the bucket's end
                                (``first_seen < bucket_end``)
          * ``total``        — urgent rows in this bucket
          * ``llm``          — score_source='llm'
          * ``ml``           — score_source='ml'
          * ``briefing_boost`` — score_source='briefing_boost'
          * ``null``         — legacy / pre-migration rows
          * ``llm_fraction`` — ``(llm + briefing_boost) / total`` (0.0 when
                                ``total == 0``)

        Top-level keys mirror ``urgency_label_split``: ``window_h``,
        ``bucket_h``, ``total`` (over all buckets), ``llm_fraction``
        (over all buckets — identical to ``urgency_label_split``'s value
        when the same window is queried).

        Read-only (single GROUP BY SELECT) with ``_LIVE_ONLY_CLAUSE`` so
        the synthetic backtest/opus rows never inflate either side. NO DB
        write, no ai_score/ml_score/score_source/urgency mutation. All
        four load-bearing invariants intact by construction.

        never be inflated/masked by an injection burst sharing the table,

        which lets ``backtest://`` URLs and ``opus_annotation*`` sources leak
        through. Use this method instead of writing a new ad-hoc scan.

        Matching is whole-word and ALL-CAPS so a substring like ``NVDAQ`` or
        ``AMDOCS`` cannot leak a hit for ``NVDA`` / ``AMD``. Tickers shorter
        than 2 chars are skipped (no signal, would over-match). A leading
        ``$`` is allowed (``$NVDA`` matches ``NVDA``).

                                  so the prior=0 case yields a finite ratio)

                                  (``None`` when no mentions at all)

        Ordered highest-ratio-first so an accelerating ticker surfaces at
        the top. A ticker with no signal at all (``ratio == 1.0`` from
        zero data) sorts below a real decelerator (whose ratio < 1.0 IS a
