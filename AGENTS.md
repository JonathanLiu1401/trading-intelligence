# digital-intern — agent guide

This guide is for AI coding agents working on this repo. CLAUDE.md has the long-form architecture
reference; this file is the operational summary plus the invariants you can break by mistake.

## Architecture at a glance

`daemon.py` is the production entry point. It spins up ~30 independent worker threads — one per
data source, plus the scoring/alerting/training pipeline — and supervises them. Article flow:

```
collectors/* → _ingest (heuristic_scorer) → ArticleStore.insert_batch
                                                │
                                                ▼
              scorer_worker → ml.inference.score_articles → either
                                                              ├─ ml.update_ml_scores_batch  (confident model)
                                                              └─ watchers.urgency_scorer    (uncertain → Sonnet → update_ai_scores_batch)
                                                │
                                                ▼
                              alert_worker → watchers.alert_agent.send_urgent_alert → Discord
                                                │
                                                ▼
                              heartbeat_worker (5h) → analysis.claude_analyst.analyze → Discord
                                                │
                                                ▼
                              ml.trainer.train (3min) — pulls ai_score=llm/briefing_boost rows + synthetic backtest rows
```

`storage/article_store.py` owns the SQLite layer. The same DB is read by paper-trader at
`/home/zeph/paper-trader/`, which both reads (live signals — must filter synthetic rows) and writes
(synthetic backtest training rows — kept in DB, hidden from live).

---

## Critical invariants — read this before touching the data path

### 1. Backtest isolation
Rows with `url LIKE 'backtest://%'` or `source LIKE 'backtest_%'` or `source LIKE 'opus_annotation%'`
are training-only artifacts injected by paper-trader. They **must never** reach:

- the live alert formatter (`watchers/alert_agent.py`)
- the heartbeat briefing (`analysis/claude_analyst.py`)
- the urgency scorer (`watchers/urgency_scorer.py`)

The canonical filter lives in `storage/article_store.py::_LIVE_ONLY_CLAUSE`. Every read path on the
live pipeline applies it:

- `get_unscored` — for ML inference + Sonnet routing
- `get_unalerted_urgent` — for the alert worker
- `get_top_for_briefing` — for the 5h Opus briefing
- `count_unscored`, `stats` — for monitoring

`send_urgent_alert` has a defense-in-depth re-filter so a future caller that bypasses the store
can't leak synthetic rows into Discord. Tests in `tests/test_article_store.py::TestBacktestIsolation`
gate this.

Training paths (`ml/trainer.py::_fetch_training_data`, `train_continuous`) deliberately include
synthetic rows — that's the whole point of the backtest replay loop. They exclude `score_source='ml'`
instead, to avoid the label-feedback loop.

### 2. ml_score vs ai_score separation
- `ai_score` — LLM ground-truth labels (`score_source` ∈ {`llm`, `briefing_boost`}). Trainer reads
  this as truth.
- `ml_score` — the model's own predictions (`score_source='ml'`). Never read by the trainer.

`update_ml_scores_batch` writes `ml_score` and tags `score_source = COALESCE(score_source, 'ml')` —
so an LLM-tagged row stays LLM-tagged even after a later model inference pass. Tests in
`TestScoreSourceSeparation` enforce this.

Readers that need a unified "effective score" use
`COALESCE(NULLIF(ai_score, 0), ml_score, 0)` (see `get_unalerted_urgent`,
`get_top_for_briefing`).

### 3. Urgency state machine
`urgency` is tri-state: `0` = normal, `1` = needs alert, `2` = alerted. All score-writing paths
use `MAX(urgency, ?)` so a fresh Sonnet rescore can never regress an alerted article back to `1`
(which would re-fire the alert). Tested in `TestAlertedMarking::test_subsequent_llm_rescore_does_not_un_alert`
and `TestPreservesAlerted::test_rescore_does_not_unalert`.

## Running the daemon

Production (systemd):
```sh
systemctl --user start digital-intern
journalctl --user -fu digital-intern
```

Foreground (development):
```sh
cd /home/zeph/digital-intern
python3 daemon.py
```

Health probe:
```sh
bash /home/zeph/digital-intern/healthcheck.sh
```

The daemon takes a singleton lock at `data/daemon.lock` — a second process waits for the first to
exit. Workers are supervised: 3+ crashes in 5 min → degraded (slow respawn); 10+ → disabled for 30
min. Discord alerts fire on state transitions only.

Dashboard runs on `:8080` (Flask). `WEB_SERVER_PORT` env overrides the bind port.

---

## Running tests

```sh
cd /home/zeph/digital-intern && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests use in-memory-ish SQLite via a `tmp_path`-redirected store fixture (`tests/conftest.py`).
External calls (Claude CLI, network) are patched. No GPU required for the model tests — they
exercise the `ArticleNetModule` directly on CPU.

**Fixture convention — `first_seen` must be time-relative.** `get_unalerted_urgent` and
`get_top_for_briefing` enforce a 24h `first_seen` freshness window. Test `_insert*` helpers
default `first_seen` to ~5 min ago (`datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(minutes=5)`), not a
hardcoded date. A literal date silently breaks every backtest-isolation test 24h later — a
green-looking invariant test that fails on a calendar boundary, not on a real regression. Pass an
explicit `first_seen=` only when a test specifically targets the staleness cutoff.

Suites:

- `test_article_store.py` — backtest isolation, alerted-marking, ml/llm score separation, CRUD.
- `test_urgency_scorer.py` — classification at the 8.0 threshold, partial Sonnet responses,
  alerted-state preservation.
- `test_features.py` — exactly 15 extra dims, ticker density, days-since-published normalization
  (`min(age,30)/30` → ~1/30 at 24h, saturates 1.0 at ≥30d; this is intended ML feature scaling,
  not a bug), cyclic feature bounds.
- `test_model.py` — output bounds (relevance 0..10, urgency 0..1, no NaN on zero input).
- `test_trainer.py` — `score_source='ml'` exclusion, synthetic-row inclusion, sample weighting,
  and `TestTrainOrchestration` — regression guard that `train()` runs end-to-end on both the
  fresh and disk-cache paths (see ML training pipeline note below).
- `test_integration_pipeline.py` — cross-module flows (ingest→score→alert, end-to-end backtest
  isolation, concurrent-writer safety).
- `test_retrain_guard.py` — `core/retrain_guard.py` escalation policy: fires exactly at the
  consecutive-failure threshold and on every multiple after, never below it, never on a
  non-positive count or misconfigured threshold (see ML pipeline note below).
- `test_alert_dedup.py` / `test_logger_rotation.py` — syndication dedup signature/merge rules and
  size-rotation of `logs/structured.jsonl`.
- `test_recursive_labeler.py` — `_apply_labels` defensive urgency parse (a non-int urgency from
  Claude must not abort the run or discard the batch's good labels), 0..5→0..10 relevance rescale,
  `score_source='llm'` on writes, and `_fetch_round1_candidates` backtest/opus exclusion (a
  separate `WHERE` filter than `_LIVE_ONLY_CLAUSE`).

## Worker roles (one line each)

| Worker | Interval | Job |
|--------|----------|-----|
| `gdelt`, `rss`, `web`, `reddit`, `ticker`, `sec_edgar`, `sec_edgar_ft`, `google_news`, `nitter`, `substack`, `finnhub`, `alphavantage`, `polygon`, `massive`, `newsapi`, `yahoo_ticker_rss`, `wikipedia` | varies | Collectors. Each polls its source, calls `_ingest`. |
| `scorer` | 30 s | Pulls `get_unscored`, runs `ArticleNet` inference, routes uncertain to Sonnet, writes `ml_score` or queues for LLM. |
| `alert` | 20 s | `get_unalerted_urgent` → `send_urgent_alert` → Discord + TTS. |
| `heartbeat` | 5 h | Opus 4.7 long-form briefing → Discord. Re-labels included articles at 4.5 for training. |
| `ml_trainer` | 3 min | Full ArticleNet retrain (100 epochs). |
| `continuous_trainer` | 2 min | Lightweight 40-epoch fine-tune to keep GPU warm. |
| `recursive_labeler` | 4 h | Sonnet bulk-labels → Opus reviews disagreements → active-learning queue. |
| `price_alert` | 5 min | Discord ping on \|%\| ≥ 3% portfolio move. |
| `purge` | 6 h | Delete rows older than `RETENTION_DAYS=90`; WAL checkpoint. |
| `portfolio_pl`, `sentiment_trends`, `export`, `stats`, `web_server` | varies | Dashboard inputs + Flask server. |

Supervisor state is in `logs/supervisor_state.json` (atomic-rename written every 5 min, consumed
by the dashboard).

## ML training pipeline

Label sources, in priority order:

1. **Opus heartbeat-derived labels** — ai_score 4.5, `score_source='briefing_boost'`. Highest signal
   quality; ~50 articles per 5h.
2. **Sonnet urgency_scorer labels** — ai_score from the Sonnet score (clamped 0.01..10),
   `score_source='llm'`.
3. **Backtest synthetic rows** — `score_source=NULL`, fractional ai_score (BUY winner=5.0,
   SELL loser=0.5, opus NEUTRAL=2.5, BAD=0.5). Allowed because they encode trade outcomes.
4. **kw_score weak labels** — bootstrap only; capped at 50% of LLM-labeled corpus or 2000 rows.

The trainer concatenates TF-IDF (15k dims) + 15 extra features. Sample-weighted MSE on relevance
(high-score articles dominate gradient) + 0.5·BCE on urgency + 0.2·BCE on uncertainty + 0.3·BCE on
time_sensitivity.

The model writes its predictions to `ml_score`. The trainer never reads `ml_score` — that's how the
label-feedback loop stays closed.

**Early stopping.** `ArticleNet.fit` takes `early_stop_patience` (default 6, the `ml_trainer`/
`continuous_trainer` callers leave it at the default). It only engages when a held-out val set
exists (`n >= 100`): after that many consecutive val checks fail to beat the running best by
`min_delta` (1e-4), training halts. Best-epoch weights are restored regardless, so early stop only
trims wasted overfitting epochs — it never changes which checkpoint is saved or the reported
`val_loss`. The metrics dict gains `epochs_run` (actual) and `stopped_early` (bool); `epochs`
stays the configured budget. `patience=0` disables it (fixed-budget back-compat). Pinned by
`tests/test_model.py::test_early_stop_triggers_on_plateau` /
`test_early_stop_disabled_runs_full_budget`.

**Dataset prep is single-pass.** `train()` builds the feature matrix exactly once, via one of two
branches: a disk-cache hit (`data/ml/dataset_cache.npz`, reused while the labeled count drifts
<5%), or a fresh `_fetch_training_data` → embed → cache-write. The fresh branch `del`s the raw
`texts`/`articles` lists to cap peak RAM before GPU training; the cache branch never builds them.
Anything after that point operates on `X / y_rel / y_urg / y_time` only — re-embedding there (the
pre-cache code shape) raises `NameError` on every cycle and ArticleNet silently stops retraining
while the daemon log still looks healthy. `TestTrainOrchestration` covers both branches.

**Retrain-failure escalation (safety net for the above).** The `NameError` blind spot was invisible
because `ml_trainer_worker` swallows retrain exceptions as `WARNING`, and the hourly healthcheck only
greps `ERROR`/`CRITICAL`. `ml_trainer_worker` now keeps a `consec_fail` counter (reset on any
successful or *skipped* train — a too-few-samples skip is not a failure) and routes the
escalate-or-not decision to the pure, unit-tested `core/retrain_guard.py::should_alert`. It fires a
Discord `is_alert=True` ping at the threshold (`ML_RETRAIN_FAIL_ALERT_THRESHOLD=3`) and re-pings on
every further multiple (6, 9, …) so a persistently broken trainer can't go stale silently again
without flooding the channel. `core/retrain_guard.py` owns the policy precisely so it stays testable
in isolation from the GPU/daemon machinery; `tests/test_retrain_guard.py` pins it.

## Common failure modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| `database is locked` retries | High writer contention with `purge_worker`'s `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`. | `_retry_on_lock` decorator handles 5 attempts with jitter. Persistent failures → check `lock_metrics()`. |
| `score_pending` returns 0 in a loop | `_INFER_LOCK` held, or model not yet fitted. | Wait for first `ml_trainer` cycle; then `[score_pending] N scored so far...` should appear. |
| Sonnet alerts missing | `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` empty, or `claude` CLI not authenticated. | Check `.env`; run `claude --version`. |
| Backtest articles leaking into Discord | A new query forgot `_LIVE_ONLY_CLAUSE`. | Grep for `FROM articles WHERE` in the store; verify every live-read path filters. Re-run `tests/test_article_store.py::TestBacktestIsolation`. |
| Model trains on its own predictions | A new write path put model output into `ai_score`. | Use `update_ml_scores_batch` for predictions, `update_ai_scores_batch` for LLM labels. Re-run `tests/test_article_store.py::TestScoreSourceSeparation`. |
| `val_loss` flat forever, model never improves, `[ml_trainer] Retrain error: name 'texts' is not defined` in `daemon.log` | A code path after dataset prep re-references `texts`/`articles` (deleted/never-built). `train()` raises every cycle but the worker swallows it as a WARNING, so the daemon looks alive. | Keep all post-prep code on `X/y_rel/y_urg/y_time`. Re-run `tests/test_trainer.py::TestTrainOrchestration`. |
| Discord `🚨 ML TRAINER STUCK: N consecutive retrain failures` | Any persistent `ml_train` exception (the `texts` NameError above, a corrupt `dataset_cache.npz`, GPU driver fault). `core/retrain_guard.py` escalates so the WARNING-only blind spot can't recur silently. | Read the `Last error:` in the alert; tail `[ml_trainer] Retrain error (#N)` in `daemon.log` for the full traceback. Counter resets on the next successful/skipped cycle. |
| LLM batch returns fewer scored items than sent (e.g. `[urgency] batch=120 scored=83`) | Claude hit its output-token limit and the JSON array came back truncated mid-element. `core/json_extract.py::extract_json_array` now salvages the complete leading elements instead of discarding the whole batch (returning `None`); the unrecovered tail stays unscored and drains over the next 1–2 cycles. | Expected/benign for very large batches. To eliminate it, lower the batch size in `watchers/urgency_scorer.py` / `ml/recursive_labeler.py`. Pinned by `tests/test_json_extract.py::TestTruncationSalvage`. |
| Heartbeat briefing posts placeholder text | `claude_analyst.analyze` returned `[analyst] No response from Claude.` | `heartbeat_worker` detects this and retries in 5 min instead of waiting the full 5 h. |
| Articles permanently stuck unscored | Sonnet returned an empty or partial response | `score_batch` floors unscored items at 0.01 when Sonnet returned at least one valid entry; the queue must drain over 1–2 cycles. |
| GPU OOM | Concurrent `_inject_and_train` from paper-trader during `ml_trainer_worker` retrain. | `_TRAIN_LOCK` serializes; lower paper-trader's `RUNS_PER_CYCLE`. `_handle_memory_error` clears CUDA cache. |
| Duplicate daemons fighting over port 8080 | Stale process didn't release the singleton lock. | The new daemon waits via blocking `flock`. Check `data/daemon.lock` for the holder PID. |
| `recursive_labeler` worker logs one WARNING per 4h cycle and `total_labeled=0`, model stops gaining gold labels | A label batch from Claude carried a non-int `urgency` (`"1"`, `"1.0"`, `"yes"`, `true`). The unguarded `int()` in `_apply_labels` used to raise, unwinding the whole pipeline and discarding the in-flight batch's good labels. Now degraded to `urgency=0` so the relevance label still lands. | Fixed in `_apply_labels` (defensive `int(float(...))` with `(TypeError, ValueError)` fallback). Pinned by `tests/test_recursive_labeler.py::TestApplyLabels::test_poison_urgency_does_not_abort_or_lose_siblings`. |

## Cross-system contract with paper-trader

`articles.db` is shared, read-only from paper-trader's live trader (`paper_trader/signals.py`),
read/write from `run_continuous_backtests.py::_inject_and_train`.

If a paper-trader read query is added against `articles.db`, it MUST inline the same SQL fragment
as `_LIVE_ONLY_CLAUSE`. Symptom of a violation: backtest titles appearing in the live trader's
prompt context.
