# AGENTS.md — paper-trader

Companion to `CLAUDE.md` aimed at coding agents that touch this repo
during automated review / fix cycles. Where `CLAUDE.md` documents the
*system*, this file documents the *workflows*.

## Repository layout (quick reference)

- `paper_trader/runner.py` — live trader main loop. **Single-instance guard** (`_acquire_singleton_lock`, `fcntl.flock` on `data/paper_trader.runner.lock`, invariant #19) refuses to boot a second trader on the same paper book — `main()` exits before the store/dashboard/ONLINE-ping when the lock is held by a live process; fails OPEN (degraded → continue) if the lock plumbing is unusable. Auto-recovery circuit breaker scoped to its own child claude subprocesses (`pkill -P os.getpid()`, invariant #18). Hourly / daily-close markers are restart-durable via the atomic `data/runner_state.json` sidecar (invariant #6)
- `paper_trader/strategy.py` — live Opus decision engine + watchlist (now injects the behavioural self-review mirror into the prompt). `_portfolio_snapshot` emits `stale_mark` per position and `_build_payload` annotates a `[STALE MARK …]` suffix so a missing-price mark (`current_price==avg_cost`, P/L $0.00) is not read by Opus as a genuine flat position (commit `f834c93`, review pass #4; advisory only, invariants #2/#12)
- `paper_trader/analytics/self_review.py` — canonical behavioural mirror; composes trade_asymmetry + capital_paralysis + open_attribution, fed into the live prompt **and** served at `/api/self-review`
- `paper_trader/analytics/trade_attribution.py` — per-fill news-to-trade attribution: *which articles plausibly preceded each recent FILLED trade?* Every other news↔trade panel (`news_edge`, `source_edge`, `signal_followthrough`, `scorer_attribution`) answers the symmetric *across-the-book* question; this is the missing per-trade audit — when the bot bought NVDA at 14:23, which highest-scored live-only articles in the prior 4h mentioned NVDA? *Implied* attribution (the literal prompt context isn't stored row-by-row), but deterministic and SSOT-clean: matches by case-insensitive **word-boundary** regex (so `MU` does not alias `MUTUAL`; `$NVDA` cashtag still hits) inside `[trade − window, trade]`, sorts by `ai_score` DESC with **closer-to-fill tie-break** (more plausibly causal). `build_trade_attribution(trades, articles, window_hours=4, max_per_trade=3, min_ai_score=2)` is pure / never raises (the `correlation`/`thesis_drift` split — endpoint owns the I/O; builder is offline & testable). **Live-only by construction** (invariant #1): the endpoint applies the canonical `url NOT LIKE 'backtest://%' AND source NOT LIKE 'backtest_%' AND source NOT LIKE 'opus_annotation%'` SQL fragment when reading `articles.db` so synthetic rows never reach the panel. **Pseudo-tickers dropped** (`CASH`/`NONE`/`NO_DECISION`/`BLOCKED`/blank — the `_parse_action_ticker` carve-out, invariant #11). **No fabrication**: a trade with zero matching articles surfaces `n_attributed: 0` with an honest "no live-only article mentioning <ticker> in the Nh before the fill" headline — the `recovery`/`loser_autopsy` negative-space-is-data precedent. Served at `/api/trade-attribution` (query params: `hours_back` 1..168, `window_hours` 0.5..24, `max_per_trade` 1..10, `min_ai_score` 0..10); SWR-cached 60s like every news-IO endpoint. Observational only, never gates, no caps (invariants #2/#12). Locked by `tests/test_trade_attribution.py` (23 tests: NO_DATA/OK ladder, pre-trade-window strict inequality both sides, MU/MUTUAL substring discriminator, `$NVDA` cashtag, pseudo-ticker drop with param test across all 5 sentinel strings, score-desc + recency tie-break determinism, min_ai_score honesty, newest-first trade ordering, malformed-input degrade-never-raise on both trades and articles).
- `paper_trader/analytics/risk_mirror.py` — third advisory mirror (after self_review + track_record): composes `build_churn` + `build_correlation` **verbatim** (single source of truth #10) into a compact `prompt_block` on the trader's *structural* risk — how concentrated the book is and how much it churns (the 2026-05-17 live pathology: ~$973 / 16.7% win-rate, 60%+ one-sector, 0.52-day median hold). No price history is fetched on the hot decision path (a per-position yfinance call is a live-cycle latency/flake risk); without it `build_correlation` is `INSUFFICIENT` and its headline is the bare "verdict withheld" sentence, so the mirror surfaces the weight-based concentration (`top_weight_pct`/`weight_hhi`/`effective_positions_naive`, computed from `market_value` unconditionally) and only uses the richer ρ headline when a caller supplies `price_history`. Observational only, never gates (invariants #2/#12 — the self_review precedent); `_safe`-wrapped so a builder fault is "no block this cycle", never "no decision". Wired into `decide()` + `_build_payload(... risk_mirror_block=)` (rendered after the track-record section); applies on next paper-trader restart. Locked by `tests/test_risk_mirror.py`
- `paper_trader/analytics/tail_risk.py` — left-tail / downside-shape diagnostic (the upside-heavy surface had none): historical 95/99% 1-day VaR (nearest-rank), positional expected-shortfall CVaR (float-robust — a value-threshold filter silently drops float-equal `-0.10` ties and halves the tail), population annualised vol & downside deviation, Fisher-Pearson population skew, worst/best day, max consecutive down-day streak, Ulcer index. Daily series resampled **byte-identically** to `dashboard.analytics_api`'s `by_day` loop (single-source-of-truth #10 spirit; vol `/n` matches its Sharpe, downside-dev `/n` matches its Sortino). Honesty-gated `NO_DATA`/`INSUFFICIENT`(<`MIN_RETURNS`=20)/`OK` (the `build_correlation` precedent — live book is 5 days so it correctly reads INSUFFICIENT until history matures). Served at `/api/tail-risk` **and** folded into `/api/analytics` as an additive `tail_risk` key so the digital-intern analyst chat inherits it. Observational only — never gates Opus, never injected into the decision prompt (invariants #2/#12). Locked by `tests/test_tail_risk.py` (hand-pinned discrete metrics + independent-impl cross-check for vol/skew) and `tests/test_core_analytics.py::TestTailRiskIntegration` (endpoint↔builder no-drift, additive-key contract)
- `paper_trader/analytics/stress_scenarios.py` — **forward** beta/concentration shock estimate: the **day-one complement to `tail_risk`**, which correctly reads `INSUFFICIENT` until the book has ≥`MIN_RETURNS`=20 daily returns (live book is ~5 days). `build_stress_scenarios(positions, total_value, classify, beta_map, now=None)` is pure `Σ weight×β×shock` over the *current marked book* — **needs zero return history**, so it produces a real $ figure precisely when `tail_risk` is dark. Three families: **market** (SPY −1/−3/−5/−10 % + a +3 % honesty-symmetry line, β-amplified — the −3 % line is **byte-identical** to `/api/risk`'s `shock_usd = Σ −0.03·β·val`, single source of truth #10, locked by `test_minus3_market_equals_api_risk_shock_formula`), **single-name** (largest position alone gaps −10 %, **no β** — the idiosyncratic risk a 60-%-of-book name carries that a diversified book does not), **sector** (heaviest sector corrects −10 % thematically, **no β** — the most decision-relevant line for the ≈98 %-in-two-AI-names live pathology). Per-position β/value computed **identically** to `dashboard.risk_api` (option ×3 cap 4, put-negated). State ladder has **no sample-size gate** (that absence *is* the feature): `NO_DATA` only when the book is empty/unpriceable, else `OK`. Honesty: betas are the approximate `_LEVERAGE_BETA` sector constants and the headline says so (decision support, not VaR). Observational only, never gates, no caps (invariants #2/#12 — the `tail_risk`/`risk_mirror` precedent); pure, never raises (garbage row/None/zero book → honest degrade). Hot-path SSOT discipline: `_LEVERAGE_BETA` is a **test-pinned verbatim copy** of `dashboard._LEVERAGE_BETA` and the strategy/reporter callers pass `sector_exposure.classify` (its own pinned copy) so the live decision path never imports the ~9k-line Flask `dashboard` (the `sector_exposure.SECTOR_MAP` precedent); the `/api/stress-scenarios` endpoint passes the *real* dashboard objects so it is the true SSOT and the copies are CI-pinned to it. Served at `/api/stress-scenarios` **and** folded into `/api/analytics` as an additive `stress_scenarios` key (digital-intern analyst chat inherits it — the `tail_risk` precedent). Wired into `decide()` + `_build_payload(... stress_block=)` (rendered **after** `sector_exposure`, **before** `event_calendar`/`WATCHLIST PRICES`) **and** `reporter._stress_line` appended to `send_hourly_summary`/`send_daily_close` (the operator who lives in Discord sees the $-at-risk without opening the stale dashboard); applies on next paper-trader restart. Locked by `tests/test_stress_scenarios.py` (exact hand-computed $ per family, SSOT no-drift, monotone loss, option-β path, no-sample-gate OK, `_safe`/NO_DATA, prompt render order, `_stress_line` verbatim+fault-degrade, `TestStressScenariosEndpoint` endpoint↔analytics↔builder no-drift, `TestBetaMapIsPinnedToDashboard`)
- `paper_trader/analytics/recovery.py` — **forward** "path back to even": the rally **from here** required to return to the `INITIAL_CASH` start (the universal P/L baseline every Discord report is measured against) and the running high-water peak, per position and for the book — the one question a losing discretionary book asks first and the 50+-builder surface had **zero** of (`/api/drawdown` owns only the *backward* "% of trough clawed back"; this is its **forward complement**). `build_recovery(drawdown_result, tail_risk_result, initial_equity, now=None)` is pure, no I/O, never raises; it **composes verbatim** (single source of truth #10) `compute_drawdown`'s `current_value`/`peak_value` + per-lot `contributors` (the option ×100 is already baked into `unrealized_pl`, read **directly** — never re-derived from `avg_cost×qty`, the `hold_discipline` precedent) and `build_tail_risk`'s realized `annualized_vol_pct` (de-annualised `/√252`). Per-position breakeven is the **raw price ratio** `(avg_cost/current_price − 1)·100` — multiplier-invariant, so an option lot needs **no ×100** (a reviewer "consistency-fixing" it by multiplying through → a `10000%` figure, locked RED — the advisor discriminator); a winner needs `0.0` (never negative noise). The σ figure is **gated on `tail_risk.state=="OK"`**: a young book (the live case) reads `INSUFFICIENT` so the %/$ targets are still emitted but the dispersion figure is **withheld** with an honest sentence (the `tail_risk`/`correlation` sample-size-honesty precedent), and it is explicitly a **dispersion scale, NOT a time forecast** (a random walk's expected first-passage to even is undefined — the headline says so, the `stress_scenarios` "beta-approx, not VaR" honesty tone). State ladder `NO_DATA` (no priced book) → `ABOVE_WATER` (book ≥ start — nothing to recover, the Discord line self-suppresses; incl. the empty-book `compute_drawdown` starting-equity fallback — the `_drawdown_line` at-high-water precedent) → `UNDERWATER`. Observational only, never gates Opus, no caps (invariants #2/#12 — the `tail_risk`/`stress_scenarios` precedent). Served at `/api/recovery` **and** folded into `/api/analytics` as an additive `recovery` key (the digital-intern analyst chat that fetches `/api/analytics` inherits it for free — the `tail_risk`/`stress_scenarios` additive-key precedent; the endpoint and the fold consume the **same** per-request `compute_drawdown`+`build_tail_risk` objects so they cannot drift) **and** `reporter._recovery_line` appended **after `_stress_line`** in `send_hourly_summary`/`send_daily_close` (the operator who lives in Discord sees the rally-to-even without opening the stale dashboard; the load-bearing HOST→CAPITAL adjacency is preserved — recovery sits before HOST). Applies on next paper-trader restart. Locked by `tests/test_recovery.py`
- `paper_trader/analytics/event_calendar.py` — **forward** scheduled-event awareness fed into the live prompt (the mirrors above are all *backward*-looking; this is the one thing a discretionary desk tracks that the engine was fully blind to: upcoming **earnings**). `build_event_calendar(positions, names_in_play, calendar_path=None, now=None, horizon_days=14)` reads digital-intern's `data/earnings_calendar.json` snapshot **directly from disk** — explicitly **not** the `:8080 /api/earnings` endpoint (a network hop on the 60s decision cycle is the documented hang/latency hazard; the `signals.py` filesystem precedent). `_pick_freshest` selects the newest-`as_of` readable candidate across USB/repo/legacy paths (the `signals._db_path` freshness discipline, invariant #15). `days_away` is **recomputed** from `earnings_date` vs `now` (a stale snapshot still yields accurate timing — the digital-intern `api_earnings` rule mirrored verbatim, single source of truth #10), past events (`< -0.5d`) dropped, and each is tiered against the held book exactly as `/api/earnings-risk`: `HELD_IMMINENT` (held & ≤3d), `HELD_SOON` (held & within horizon), `WATCH` (in-play, not held; dropped beyond `horizon_days` as prompt noise — a *held* name's print is never hidden regardless of distance). Observational only, never gates (invariants #2/#12 — the self_review/risk_mirror precedent); `_safe`-style end-to-end so a missing/stale/corrupt/unparseable snapshot degrades to one honest line, **never** an exception that sinks a trading cycle. Served at `/api/event-calendar` (prompt↔endpoint parity — the existing network-sourced `/api/earnings-risk` left untouched, a different concern). Wired into `decide()` + `_build_payload(... event_calendar_block=)` (rendered after `risk_mirror`, before `WATCHLIST PRICES`); applies on next paper-trader restart. **Load-bearing scope:** `decide()` passes held ∪ the **full WATCHLIST** — deliberately **not** the lean `_names_in_play` set the quant / track-record blocks trim to. Those blocks are large per-ticker so they bound prompt length; an earnings event within the 14d horizon is rare (≈0–3 across all 50 names) so there is no bloat to bound, and `WATCHLIST[:5]` excludes most names (e.g. NVDA) — narrowing to `_names_in_play` would silently re-create the exact blind spot this closes (Opus buying a watchlist name the day before its print) **and** break the `/api/event-calendar` parity claim. Do not "consistency-fix" it to `_names_in_play`. Locked by `tests/test_event_calendar.py`
- `paper_trader/analytics/news_velocity.py` — **per-held-ticker** news-flow velocity (2026-05-18): is the catalyst BUILDING or FADING? Compares the article rate over the last `window_hours` (default 24h) to a **non-overlapping** `baseline_hours` (default 168h = prior 6 days) baseline and emits a Poisson z-score plus a state ladder (`SURGING` / `STABLE` / `FADING` / `INSUFFICIENT` / `NO_DATA`). Fills the gap left by adjacent surfaces: `analytics/position_thesis.py` reports the latest 24h headlines per held position (single-window snapshot, no baseline); digital-intern's `analytics/trend_velocity.py` is market-wide 2h-vs-prior-2h (not held-keyed); digital-intern's `analytics/breaking_news_detector.py` is 5-min burst detection (not thesis evolution). None answer the one question this does: *is the news flow on a position I actually own getting LOUDER or QUIETER?* `build_news_velocity(articles, held_tickers, now=None, window_hours=24.0, baseline_hours=168.0)` is **pure** (no DB / no network / never raises on garbage); the endpoint owns the I/O. Sample-size honesty mirrors `build_tail_risk`/`build_correlation`: per-ticker verdict is **withheld** (`INSUFFICIENT`) until `MIN_BASELINE_N=5` baseline articles exist for that ticker — the documented shallow articles.db history (~days deep, not 90) means INSUFFICIENT is the common branch on a new/quiet name and that is honest reporting, not a bug. `SURGING` requires **both** a Poisson z ≥ `Z_SURGE=2.0` AND `window_count ≥ MIN_WINDOW_FOR_SURGE=3` so a baseline of 1 vs a window of 2 (z=+0.6, count=2) does **not** false-positive. Ticker bucketing uses the canonical word-boundary regex `(?:\$|\b)TKR\b` (so `MU` does NOT alias `MUSE`/`MUTUAL`; `$NVDA` cashtag hits; `AMDOCS` ≠ `AMD` — the same locks as `trade_attribution` / `signal_followthrough`). Window-cutoff boundary is **inclusive on the window side** (`first_seen >= now - window_h`) — the `signals.py` precedent. `per_ticker` sorted SURGING-first then STABLE/FADING by z DESC then INSUFFICIENT last so the loudest catalyst surfaces at index 0. Served at `/api/news-velocity` (query params: `window_hours` 1..72, `baseline_hours` window+1..720, `tickers` comma-separated override of held). **Endpoint performance discipline**: a single DESC LIMIT query under-samples the baseline on a high-throughput day (live 2026-05-18 articles.db is 1.47M live rows in 7d, so any `LIMIT N DESC` pull returns only window-era rows — collapsing every baseline_count to 0 and forcing INSUFFICIENT everywhere). Fix: window + baseline are two queries, with the baseline using a **per-ticker `title LIKE '%TKR%'` union in SQL** so the scan drops from ~hundreds-of-thousands of rows to a few thousand before Python word-boundary refinement (1s vs 40s end-to-end). Title-only for baseline rows (skip ~hundreds of full_text decompressions — title regex captures the bucket reliably). Live-only clause applied (invariant #3 — `url NOT LIKE 'backtest://%' AND source NOT LIKE 'backtest_%' AND source NOT LIKE 'opus_annotation%'`). Reads the articles.db via the freshness-aware `_articles_db_path()` (invariant #15/#17). Observational only, never gates Opus, no caps (invariants #2/#12 — the `tail_risk`/`stress_scenarios` precedent). Locked by `tests/test_news_velocity.py` (25 tests: state-ladder honesty including the at-MIN_BASELINE_N FADING-not-INSUFFICIENT boundary, exact hand-computed Poisson z + ratio, surge-requires-both-z-AND-floor regression, window-cutoff strict inclusivity, MU≠MUSE/MUTUAL/AMDOCS≠AMD word-boundary discriminators, sort priority SURGING-first/INSUFFICIENT-last, case-insensitive held-ticker dedup, defensive `baseline ≤ window` → NO_DATA, garbage-row degrade-never-raise, plus `TestNewsVelocityEndpoint` Flask test_client coverage for no-DB degrade / ticker override / param garbage-clamp).
- `paper_trader/analytics/implied_move.py` — **forward, market-priced** complement to the backward-looking `earnings_shock` (historical-Gaussian σ) and `earnings_distribution` (empirical observed quartiles). Answers the discretionary trader's #1 pre-earnings question: *"what is the market currently pricing as the move on this print?"*. For each held imminent earnings event (held ∩ event_calendar within `horizon_days`=7), pulls the options chain at the expiry closest to `ceil(days_away)` so the chain **captures** the event, picks the ATM call (min `|strike − spot|`) and ATM put **independently** (so a one-sided chain gap doesn't silently mis-pair), computes the straddle mid as `(bid+ask)/2` when both > 0 else `lastPrice` else `None` (NaN-rejected — yfinance returns NaN for thin chains and a half-NaN sum would silently halve every implied), and reports `implied_move_pct = straddle / spot * 100` (desk-standard breakeven-move shorthand) plus the strict Black-Scholes 1σ ≈ 0.8 × straddle/spot and the per-strike `iv_atm` (decimal → percent). Dollarized: `position_value × implied_pct / 100 → $-at-risk`; `book_pct = $-at-risk / total_value * 100`. State ladder mirrors `earnings_shock`: `NO_DATA` (empty/unpriceable book) / `NO_EVENTS` (book fine, calendar quiet — distinct so the operator can tell "calendar quiet" from "book empty") / `OK`. Per-event honesty: `OK` / `NO_QUOTES` (chain returned but ATM bid/ask/last all zero — withhold rather than fabricate 0%) / `NO_CHAIN` (provider returned None or raised — `_safe` contract, never propagates). Composes `build_event_calendar`'s `events` list **verbatim** (single source of truth #10) so this endpoint, `/api/earnings-shock`, `/api/earnings-distribution` and `/api/event-calendar` can never disagree on what counts as held-imminent. Option positions degrade to `NO_CHAIN` (the current_price is the premium, not the underlying — an implied-move read on an option-on-an-earnings-name is its own feature, not this one). Pure builder, never raises on garbage rows (the `_safe` discipline); the endpoint owns the yfinance I/O (`market.get_options_chain` via a `_chain_provider` lambda). Served at `/api/implied-move`, SWR-cached 5 min matching `/api/earnings-shock` cadence, and registered in the prewarm set (the `test_swr_prewarm_coverage` invariant). Observational only, never gates Opus, never injected into the decision prompt, no caps (invariants #2/#12 — the `earnings_shock` / `stress_scenarios` / `recovery` precedent). Locked by `tests/test_implied_move.py` (34 tests: helper-fn discriminators (NaN-rejected `_safe_float`, mid-wins-over-last `_mid_or_last`, min-distance `_atm_row`); state ladder NO_DATA / NO_EVENTS-distance / NO_EVENTS-unheld / OK; exact hand-computed arithmetic on a pinned $1000-book NVDA scenario (`straddle=8.0 → implied=8% → $32 → 3.2% of book → MODERATE`); ELEVATED/MODERATE/LOW threshold boundaries; degrade paths NO_CHAIN-on-None / NO_CHAIN-on-raise / NO_QUOTES-on-thin / option-position-no-spot / garbage-row-never-raises / past-event-dropped; sort order by `days_to_earnings`; total_implied_book_pct sum-of-abs; `TestImpliedMoveEndpoint` Flask test_client (offline-deterministic via monkeypatched `market.get_options_chain` + on-disk event_calendar fixture) — endpoint↔builder no-drift on the load-bearing fields, empty-book→NO_DATA-not-500)
- `paper_trader/analytics/pnl_attribution.py` — **β-adjusted** decomposition of open unrealized P/L into `β·SPY-explained` vs **idiosyncratic** residual. The honest answer to *"is my NVDA gain just SPY going up?"* — `analytics/open_attribution.py` (`/api/open-attribution`) reports the unweighted `position_return − spy_return`, which **implicitly assumes β=1** and so systematically over-attributes "alpha" on the bot's documented leveraged-ETF/semis book (TQQQ β=3, NVDA β=1.5, FNGU β=3); the desk-correct read is `idiosyncratic = position_return − β × spy_return`. The discriminating disagreement: a +1% SPY day on a $200 TQQQ position contributes ≈$6 of β·SPY-explained P/L, not $2. `build_pnl_attribution(positions, equity_curve, classify, beta_map, now=None)` is pure (no I/O, never raises — the `_safe` contract). Anchors per-position to the equity curve's `sp500_price` at-or-after `opened_at` (same SSOT as `open_attribution`'s `_spy_at_or_after`, AGENTS.md #10 — a drift in either side fails the no-drift check). Uses the **same** `_classify`/`_LEVERAGE_BETA` SSOT as `stress_scenarios` / `/api/risk` so an unknown-sector ticker reads β=1.0 *exactly* the same as those panels do; an unmapped ticker → `classify→"other"` → β=1.0 (market-beta fallback, the `_position_betas` precedent). Options are flagged and skipped (β-attribution on a Greeks instrument is its own surface, see `/api/greeks` — the `open_attribution` precedent). State ladder `NO_DATA` (no stock positions / all skipped) / `NO_BENCHMARK` (positions exist but equity curve has no `sp500_price` history — cold start before the first equity tick) / `INSUFFICIENT` (positions exist + benchmark exists but no position's `opened_at` anchors against the available SPY history, e.g. all opened *after* the last equity tick — the row is still emitted with `anchored=False` for honest withholding) / `OK` (at least one anchored row). Per-row fields: `beta`, `position_return_pct`, `spy_return_pct`, `beta_explained_pct = β × spy_return`, `idiosyncratic_pct = position_return − beta_explained`, plus all four dollarized. Book totals satisfy `unrealized_usd = beta_explained_usd + idiosyncratic_usd` exactly (asserted in the suite). Rows sorted by `|idiosyncratic_usd|` DESC (the desk's "what is selection actually contributing" sort), unanchored rows last. Served at `/api/pnl-attribution` (the **true SSOT** — strategy-side pinned copies are CI-pinned to its `_classify`/`_LEVERAGE_BETA`) **and** folded into `/api/analytics` as an additive `pnl_attribution` key (digital-intern analyst chat that fetches `/api/analytics` inherits it for free — the `tail_risk`/`stress_scenarios`/`recovery` additive-key precedent). Observational only, never gates Opus, never injected into the decision prompt, no caps (invariants #2/#12 — the `open_attribution` precedent). Locked by `tests/test_pnl_attribution.py` (19 tests: state ladder NO_DATA-empty / NO_DATA-options-only / NO_BENCHMARK-no-SPY / INSUFFICIENT-opened-after-curve; **exact hand-computed β-decomposition** on a pinned NVDA β=1.5 scenario (`+10% pos, +1% SPY, +1.5% β-explained, +8.5% idio`); the **TQQQ leveraged discriminator** (`+6% pos, +2% SPY, β=3 → β-explained=6%, idio=0% — vs `open_attribution`'s would-be +4% naive alpha — that disagreement IS the value-add); negative-idiosyncratic-on-losing-leveraged-ETF (TQQQ flat while SPY +1%, β=3 → idio=-3%); totals math (book unrealized = β-explained + idiosyncratic, exact); unknown-ticker→β=1 fallback; option-skip; classify-raises→other-fallback (`_safe`); garbage-position-never-raises; corrupt-equity-curve-row-skipped; sort by |idio| DESC with unanchored last; `TestPnlAttributionEndpoint` Flask test_client (real Store + `update_position_marks` to seed `current_price`) — endpoint serves builder output with `β=1.5` on NVDA (the dashboard's true SSOT); `TestAnalyticsFold` no-drift between `/api/analytics["pnl_attribution"]` and `/api/pnl-attribution` on the load-bearing fields)
- `paper_trader/analytics/idle_opportunity.py` — **drought-regret** quantifier (2026-05-19): during the current PARALYSIS drought, which high-score live signals on the watchlist arrived that the bot never decided against? The recurring host-saturation NO_DECISION storms have three diagnostic surfaces — `/api/decision-drought` (WHEN + realized portfolio drift), `/api/host-guard`+`/api/decision-forensics` (WHY: host load + dominant parse-fail mode), `/api/shadow-vs-claude` (RIGHT-NOW rec, **snapshot-only by design** per its docstring, does not look across the drought window) — but none answer the operator's "while the bot was dark for 9.0h, did anything high-score actually arrive on a name I follow that I would have acted on?" question. `build_idle_opportunity(decision_drought_result, articles, watchlist, held_tickers=None, now=None, min_ai_score=6.0, max_opportunities=20)` is pure (no I/O, never raises on garbage — the `_safe` contract). **Composes `build_decision_drought.current_drought` verbatim** (SSOT, AGENTS.md #10 — so `/api/idle-opportunity` and `/api/decision-drought` can never disagree on what counts as an ongoing drought). Buckets live-only watchlist articles at-or-above the score floor inside `[drought_start, now]` per ticker, keeping the top article per ticker (score DESC, tie-break **newer first_seen** — more plausibly causal, the `trade_attribution` precedent). State ladder `NO_DATA` (no decisions yet) → `NO_DROUGHT` (bot filling normally — by definition nothing was missed, suppressed in reports) → `OK` (drought exists; `n_opportunities` carries the regret list, possibly empty — the silence-when-nothing-actionable case, the `_macro_calendar_chat_lines`/`_event_readiness_chat_lines` precedent). Word-boundary regex `(?:\$|\b)TKR\b` (so `MU` does NOT alias `MUTUAL`/`MUSE`; `$NVDA` cashtag hits; `AMDOCS` ≠ `AMD` — the same locks as `news_velocity` / `trade_attribution` / `signal_followthrough`). NaN/Inf `ai_score` explicitly rejected (digital-intern's column has been observed with stale NaNs from a half-trained model; Python NaN compared with min_ai_score is ALWAYS False which would silently drop the row otherwise). Held positions flagged via `held` so the headline can call out *"the bot was dark on MY OWN position's news"*. Served at `/api/idle-opportunity` (query params: `min_ai_score` 0..10, `max_opportunities` 1..50). **Endpoint short-circuits when no ongoing drought** — saves the articles.db read entirely (the operator-happy path; same cost discipline as `news_velocity`'s drought-bounded scan, typically narrows to hundreds of rows even on the 1.47M-rows/7d articles.db).

- `paper_trader/analytics/etf_lookthrough.py` — **single-name look-through** through leveraged-ETF positions (2026-05-19): pierce TQQQ/SOXL/FNGU/TECL/SPXL/etc. into the *effective* per-ticker exposure a book of NVDA + TQQQ truly carries. Every existing risk surface stops at the ticker boundary — `sector_exposure` classifies TQQQ as `broad_lev` and adds the full position to that sector; `risk_mirror` reports HHI on line-item tickers; `pnl_attribution` β-decomposes the move but does NOT pierce the ETF wrapper. The decision-relevant question this answers: *"I hold $445 NVDA cash AND $295 TQQQ. TQQQ is 3x QQQ, QQQ is ~9% NVDA. What is my TRUE effective NVDA exposure?"* Live answer on the actual book (2026-05-19): **52.4% effective NVDA vs 44.5% direct (8pp hidden via TQQQ amplification)**, plus **silent MSFT/AAPL/AMZN** lines via TQQQ that have **zero direct positions** but ride the next NVDA earnings move with the book regardless. `build_etf_lookthrough(snapshot, lookthrough_map=None, hidden_ratio=1.5, max_underlyings=12)` is pure (no I/O, never raises — the `_safe` contract). Position value mirrors `sector_exposure._position_value` **verbatim** (single source of truth #10 — same `(current_price or avg_cost) * qty * (100 if option else 1)` formula, so starting weights cannot drift). For each held position: if ticker is in `_ETF_LOOKTHROUGH`, decompose into virtual exposures `position_value × leverage × weight%`; otherwise contribute as direct. Inverse ETFs (SQQQ/SOXS/SPXS/FNGD/TECS) carry NEGATIVE leverage so they honestly SHORT their basket — a book of NVDA + SQQQ reads net NVDA = direct − indirect (the sign honesty IS the value-add — locked RED by the inverse-ETF test). Options skipped from look-through (delta-adjustment is its own surface — the `pnl_attribution` option-skip precedent) but still contribute as direct exposure. Per-underlying tier ladder: `HIDDEN_AMPLIFIED` (effective_pct ≥ `HIDDEN_RATIO`=1.5× direct_pct), `HIDDEN_ONLY` (no direct line, ETF-only exposure — the silent-MSFT case), `TRANSPARENT` (look-through within 1.5×), `TRIVIAL` (<0.5% of book). State ladder `NO_DATA` (no priced book) / `NO_ETF_HELD` (book exists but no mapped ETF held — look-through ≡ direct, suppressed in reports — the `decision_drought`/`no_decision_recovery` silence-when-nothing-actionable precedent) / `OK`. Sort by `|effective_usd|` DESC tie-break `direct_usd` DESC. Headline priority: HIDDEN_AMPLIFIED → HIDDEN_ONLY → largest-effective fallback. Served at `/api/etf-lookthrough` **and** folded into `/api/analytics` as an additive `etf_lookthrough` key (digital-intern analyst chat that fetches `/api/analytics` inherits it for free — the `tail_risk`/`stress_scenarios`/`recovery`/`pnl_attribution` additive-key precedent). Observational only, never gates Opus, no caps (invariants #2/#12). Static weights are approximate top-10 issuer-fact-sheet constituents (late-2025); the headline says so — decision support, not VaR.

- `paper_trader/analytics/earnings_war_room.py` — **pre-print game plan** composer (2026-05-19): one composite view answering *"if NVDA gaps by its implied move tomorrow, what does my book actually look like after?"*. Forward-earnings exposure has six siloed surfaces today (`/api/event-calendar`, `/api/implied-move`, `/api/earnings-shock`, `/api/earnings-distribution`, `/api/stress-scenarios`, `/api/sector-exposure`) and none composes the worst-case projection: post-shock book value vs the $1000 start, post-shock concentration, total $-at-risk across all held imminent prints. `build_earnings_war_room(positions, total_value, initial_equity, event_calendar_result, implied_move_result=None, earnings_shock_result=None, stress_scenarios_result=None, now=None, horizon_days=7.0)` is the composer — **no new measurement** beyond `position_value × shock_pct` arithmetic and the post-shock book-value projection; every input is read **verbatim** (single source of truth #10) from the sibling builders' results so this endpoint and the sibling endpoints can never disagree. Per-event row: `weight_pct`, `implied_move_pct`+`implied_dollar_at_risk`+`implied_book_pct` (from `implied_move`), `sigma_pct`+`sigma_dollar_move`+`sigma_book_pct` (from `earnings_shock`), `single_name_shock_dollar` (from `stress_scenarios.single_name` when ticker matches — verbatim SSOT — else a verbatim copy of `_SINGLE_NAME_GAP_PCT=-10` applied to position value; `single_name_shock_source` reads `"stress"`/`"default"` so drift is auditable), `post_shock_total_value` (book mark-to-market after this position drops by `|implied_move_pct|`, others flat — the worst-direction frame), `post_shock_vs_initial_pct` (vs the $1000 baseline), `post_shock_weight_pct` (concentration after the shock — provably reduces vs starting weight, locked). Per-event impact tier = `max(|implied_book_pct|, |sigma_book_pct|)`: HIGH ≥ 5 %, MEDIUM ≥ 2 %, LOW below. The MAX-over-both means a chain miss still tiers off historical σ AND an IPO-name with no prior prints still tiers off the implied straddle (the discriminating value-add: a row never goes UNKNOWN merely because one of two sources is missing). Top-level: `total_implied_dollars_at_risk` (sum of |implied|), `worst_case_event` (largest |implied|, fallback |σ|, fallback |single-name|), `verdict` (tier of the worst event), one-line Discord-ready `headline`. State ladder: `NO_DATA` (empty/unpriceable book) / `NO_EVENTS` (priced book, no held imminent event ≤ horizon — distinct so the operator can tell "calendar quiet" from "book empty") / `OK`. Per-event state ladder is independent: `OK` (at least one of implied/σ available) / `INSUFFICIENT` (both missing — row still emits ticker/days/weight so the operator never misses *"NVDA reports tomorrow"*, the `earnings_shock` honesty precedent). Served at `/api/earnings-war-room`, SWR-cached 5 min matching the sibling earnings endpoints, and registered in the prewarm set (the `test_swr_prewarm_coverage` invariant).

- `paper_trader/analytics/news_source_mix.py` — **per-held-ticker source-diversity verdict** (2026-05-19): is the catalyst REAL or a SYNDICATED ECHO? Orthogonal to `news_velocity` (which measures rate): a SURGING z-score of +4 looks identical whether five outlets are reporting genuine news OR one wire is being mirrored across five feeds. `build_news_source_mix` counts DISTINCT collector sources per held ticker over `window_hours` (default 24h) and tags `STRONG` (≥4 sources, ≥3 articles), `MODERATE` (≥2 sources, ≥3 articles), `ECHO` (≥`ECHO_MIN_ARTICLES`=3 articles AND single source ≥`ECHO_THRESHOLD_PCT`=70%), or `QUIET` (<2 articles). Combined with velocity: `SURGING + STRONG = real catalyst worth re-evaluating`, `SURGING + ECHO = syndication artifact — do NOT chase`. Pure builder; the endpoint owns the articles.db I/O via `_articles_db_path()` (invariant #15/#17) + live-only SQL clause + per-ticker `title LIKE` union (same cost discipline as `news_velocity`). `reporter._source_mix_line` appended to `send_hourly_summary` and `send_daily_close` **only when at least one held ticker reads ECHO** — every other state is silent (the silence-when-nothing-actionable precedent). Folded into `/api/analytics` as an additive `news_source_mix` key so the digital-intern analyst chat inherits the breadth verdict for free (the `tail_risk`/`stress_scenarios` additive-key precedent).

- `paper_trader/analytics/reentry_velocity.py` — **per-ticker close→re-buy cadence** distribution (2026-05-19): the missing fast-flip surface. `round_trips.build_round_trips` groups raw trades into closed round-trips; `track_record` composes the loser/winner-autopsy narrative; `churn` measures size-weighted intraday turnover. None answer *"after closing a position, how quickly did the desk re-enter the same ticker?"* — the documented live pathology (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md: `avg_holding_days` ~0.27 with the NVDA→LITE→NVDA shape and `KNIFE_CATCH` repeats). `build_reentry_velocity` is pure — composes `build_round_trips` (single source of truth #10) and walks each (ticker,type,strike,expiry) key's exits to the next same-key entry, computing the hour-gap distribution and bucket histogram `IMMEDIATE` (<1h) / `SAME_DAY` (1h..24h) / `QUICK` (1..3d) / `NORMAL` (3..14d) / `RARE` (>14d). Open positions whose key has a prior closed round-trip surface as `open_after_close=True` so the *live* fast-flip case is visible too (round_trips alone never sees a still-open re-entry). Verdict ladder `CHURN_RISK` (median gap <24h with ≥3 gaps) / `STABLE` / `SPARSE` (no gaps yet — the live cold-start state). Served at `/api/reentry-velocity` (query param: `recent_limit` 1..100, default 10).

- `paper_trader/analytics/blocked_repeats.py` — **repeated-BLOCKED action audit** (2026-05-19): orthogonal to every NO_DECISION surface (which says Claude didn't reply) — this catches the case where Claude DID reply but the engine rejected the trade, **and Opus keeps retrying the same action**. `decisions.action_taken` carries `"BUY NVDA → BLOCKED"` (invariant #11) with the BLOCKED reason in the JSON reasoning blob's `detail` field; nothing on the dashboard or in Discord named it. `build_blocked_repeats` is pure — parses (verb, ticker) from the action_taken prefix, classifies each detail to `CASH` / `DATA` / `SIZING` / `SPECIFICATION` / `OTHER` via a pinned phrase map (every documented `strategy._execute` BLOCKED message has a mapping), aggregates by (verb, ticker), filters to `count >= min_repeat` (default 2), and sorts by count DESC then latest_ts DESC. The cause buckets are operator-actionable: **CASH** = fund the trade, **DATA** = fix the feed, **SIZING** = re-prompt Opus with held qty, **SPECIFICATION** = clarify strike/expiry/qty. Verdict ladder `CLEAN` (no repeats — silent in any future reporter wiring) / `REPEATING` (≥1 repeat — headline names worst offender, count, dominant_cause). Served at `/api/blocked-repeats` (query params: `limit` 50..5000 default 500, `min_repeat` 2..20 default 2). Observational only — never gates Opus, never injected into the decision prompt, no caps (invariants #2/#12). Locked by `tests/test_blocked_repeats.py` (41 tests: every pinned cause phrase → bucket; sort tiebreaker (count DESC, then newest-latest_ts first); per-(verb, ticker) key isolation (BUY NVDA ≠ BUY_CALL NVDA); FILLED rows excluded; min_repeat override; malformed JSON reasoning + non-dict rows degrade-never-raise; the load-bearing **test-isolation rule below**; `TestEndpoint` offline-deterministic via pure list-backed stub Store).
- `paper_trader/analytics/rebuy_regret.py` — **sell-then-rebuy $ regret** quantifier (2026-05-20): did the desk save or lose money on close→re-entry hops? `reentry_velocity` tracks the *time* gap; `churn` measures size-weighted turnover; `hold_discipline` reports hold duration. None answer *"when I sold a name and bought it back later, did I save money or lose money in the round-trip-to-re-entry hop?"* The discriminating disagreement vs `reentry_velocity`: a fast re-entry is not inherently bad — what matters is the *price delta* over the gap. Selling NVDA at $220 and re-buying 2h later at $218 *saved* money (timing edge); re-buying at $223 *cost* money (whipsaw). `build_rebuy_regret(trades, now=None, recent_limit=10)` is pure — composes `build_round_trips` (SSOT, invariant #10) for closed round-trips, then walks the trade stream for the next same-key BUY to measure `(rebuy_price − sell_price) × min(sell_qty, rebuy_qty)` against shared quantity, with the option ×100 multiplier honored (the `round_trips` precedent). Sign convention: **positive regret_usd = lost** (sold low, bought back higher); **negative = saved** (sold high, bought back lower). Per-event ladder: `REGRET_HIGH` (>$5) / `REGRET` ($0.50..$5) / `NEUTRAL` (±$0.50) / `SAVED` (−$0.50..−$5) / `SAVED_HIGH` (<−$5). Top-level verdict: `REGRETTING` / `SAVINGS` / `NET_NEUTRAL` / `NO_REBUYS` / `NO_DATA`. Per-ticker rollup sorted worst offender first. Headline names the worst single event by ticker, sold price, re-bought price. Pure / no I/O / never raises (the `_safe` contract — pre-filters garbage rows so `build_round_trips`'s raw `t["ticker"]` cannot KeyError).

- `paper_trader/analytics/news_to_trade_lag.py` — **news-to-trade lag distribution** (2026-05-20): is the desk reacting to fresh news or consistently 2 hours behind? `/api/trade-attribution` enumerates the highest-scored articles preceding each FILLED trade with a `minutes_before_trade` per attributed article; this builder compresses that detail to one distribution + verdict on the desk's *reactivity*. Composes `build_trade_attribution` (SSOT, invariant #10). For each attributed trade, takes the **minimum** `minutes_before_trade` across its attributed articles (the freshest plausibly-causal signal the trade could have reacted to). Trades with zero attributions are counted separately (`n_no_attribution`); honestly **excluded** from the distribution rather than assigned `window_hours` as a fake worst case (the `recovery`/`loser_autopsy` negative-space-is-data precedent — silence ≠ `= max`). Distribution surface: `min/p25/median/p75/max` of min-lag-minutes, nearest-rank quantile (math.ceil-based, no banker's-rounding shift) — the `tail_risk` precedent (no interpolation). Bucket counts: `bucket_fast` (<30min) / `bucket_reactive` (30..120) / `bucket_delayed` (≥120). Verdict ladder: `REACTIVE_FAST` (median <30) / `REACTIVE` (30..120) / `DELAYED` (≥120) / `NO_ATTRIBUTION` (>50% trades lack live news — **trumps** the numeric verdict so a one-attributed-trade median doesn't whipsaw the desk-wide verdict) / `NO_DATA`. Per-trade row: ticker/action/trade_ts/top_score (highest ai_score across attributed, orthogonal to freshest)/min_lag_minutes/classification/top_title. Pure / no I/O / never raises (the `_safe` contract — None/non-dict input → NO_DATA, non-list `trades` field → NO_DATA, garbage articles in attributed list skipped, negative/None `minutes_before_trade` rejected).

All composed from existing store reads — no new state, observational only, same failure contract (store/compute fault → `""`, never an exception). The cutoff is a lexically-comparable UTC isoformat string (the `signals.py` `first_seen` pattern). Answers the trader's "did the bot do anything, and am I beating SPY this window?" from Discord without opening the (often slow/stale) dashboard. Locked by `tests/test_core_reporter.py` (`TestClassifyDecisionOutcome` / `TestActivityCounts` cutoff-inclusive boundary / `TestMovers` identity / `TestWindowDelta` exact port/spy/alpha + spy-missing degrade / `TestSessionBlock` end-to-end on a real temp Store + hourly-summary integration). **Also (2026-05-19): `_session_block` appends a true-realized-P/L line for round-trips that closed in the window** — `Closed N trip(s) (WW/LL) realized $±X.XX` — driven by a new `_realized_pl_window(trades, since_iso)` helper that mirrors `_realized_pl_today` but uses a lexical ISO comparison instead of a date-only `startswith` so arbitrary windows (1h / 4h / 24h) compose. Same SSOT as the daily close (`build_round_trips`, invariant #10) — the hourly's realized figure and the daily close's realized line can never disagree on what counts as a closed trip. Suppressed when nothing closed in the window (the silence-when-nothing-actionable precedent) so a quiet hour adds no noise; same additive failure contract (a builder fault drops just this line, never the whole report). Live verified on the 2026-05-19 book — 24h preview reads `Closed 1 trip (0W/1L) realized $-0.45`.

It answers "what did I actually lock in today?", distinct from the pre-existing **cash-flow-basis** line (a BUY-only day reads as a large negative there — correct-by-disclosure, so that line is left untouched, not reinterpreted). Same failure contract: any fault drops just this one line (`None`), never the report. A position merely opened today does not count; an old-open/today-close trip is attributed to today because `build_round_trips` pairs BUY→SELL in ledger order (deep `recent_trades(5000)` window passed so the open leg is in scope). Locked by `tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestSendDailyCloseRealizedRoundTrips` (exact `$+70.00` on a 2-closed/1-open NVDA+MU+AMD ledger with `1W/1L`; no-line-when-nothing-closed; singular-grammar). **Also (2026-05-17, review pass #4): `_portfolio_lines` appends `⚠ STALE` when a position carries `stale_mark=True`** — additive only, `open_positions()` table rows lack the key so the existing Discord path is byte-identical (a genuinely flat $0.00 is never falsely flagged). Locked by `tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestPortfolioLines`. **Also (2026-05-18): `_host_pulse_line` — the #1 live-pathology operator surface.** The recurring multi-hour `NO_DECISION` **PARALYSIS** droughts are host saturation: the live trader's Opus call OOM-starved by out-of-band parallel Opus (review / backtest agents). Observed live 2026-05-18: a **27.8 h** drought, **70/90** cycles `NO_DECISION`, **−5.87% alpha bleed** — and *invisible from Discord*. Worse, `_capital_pulse_line` (which does reach Discord) frames the same freeze as `CAPITAL ◈ PINNED`, steering the operator to *sell a position* when the real, provable fix is OPS (kill the parallel Opus jobs — selling frees cash but the next decision still won't happen). `_host_pulse_line` composes `host_guard.pulse()` **verbatim** (single source of truth #10 — state/headline never re-derived, so this line, `/api/host-guard` and the CLI can't drift) and is appended **before** `_capital_pulse_line` in `send_hourly_summary`/`send_daily_close` so a top-down read hits the non-trading-fixable cause first; the two can be independently true and **neither suppresses the other** — the `host_guard._OPS_ACTION` discriminator (`"the bot cannot resolve this by trading"`) in the headline is what stops the operator conflating them. `host_guard.pulse()` state ladder: `SATURATED` (the live /proc probe trips now — wins regardless of log) → `STARVED` (probe clear now but ≥ `host_guard.STARVATION_RATE_FLOOR`=0.25 of recent decisions never reached Opus — an intermittent storm whose damage is in the decision log) → `CLEAR` (suppressed, nothing actionable — the `_capital_pulse_line` precedent). **Load-bearing:** the rate is `host_guard.recent_starvation_rate()`, which counts **both** the old `claude returned no response` *and* the new `skipped claude call` reasoning prefixes — `recent_empty_rate` (old prefix only) collapses toward zero precisely when the pre-flight guard is most active (the documented `/api/host-guard` trap), so keying STARVED off the empty-only rate would go dark in the exact storm it must catch. `reason` is carried verbatim from `snapshot()`; a probe failure / DB-unreadable starvation probe (`ok=False`) never trips STARVED (never cry wolf — the `host_saturated` mem==0 precedent). `pulse()` is **inert under pytest** on the real path unless a test passes the `_snapshot`/`_starv` injectors or flips `_PULSE_TEST_FORCE` (the `dashboard._swr_active` offline-invariant precedent — keeps the broad reporter integration tests deterministic on a saturated CI box). Folded into `/api/host-guard` as an additive `pulse` key (dashboard/analyst inherit the same SSOT verdict — the `tail_risk`/`stress_scenarios` additive-key precedent). Observational only, never gates, no caps (invariants #2/#12); fault → `""`, never *no summary*; applies on next paper-trader restart (the documented pattern for every recent feature). Locked by `tests/test_host_guard.py` (`recent_starvation_rate` both-prefix divergence asserted *against* `recent_empty_rate` on the same DB; `TestPulse` — SATURATED-wins-regardless, floor-boundary inclusive, unreadable-log-never-cries-wolf, verbatim-`reason` no-drift, degrade-safe-never-raises, inert-under-pytest + force-flag override) and `tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestHostPulseLine` (CLEAR→`""`, SATURATED/STARVED headline verbatim incl. the OPS discriminator, fault→`""`, daily-close wiring, and the load-bearing **HOST-before-CAPITAL ordering** lock in `send_hourly_summary` with both lines independently emitted). **Also (2026-05-19): `_next_session_line` — off-hours orientation cue for the Discord operator.** A trader checking the hourly at 2 AM ET or on a weekend saw positions + stale marks with zero "when can I act next?" cue. Composes a new pure `market.next_session_open(now)` helper **verbatim** (single source of truth — the NYSE_HOLIDAYS_2026 calendar now has one consumer in market.py read by `is_market_open`/`close_minute`/this) into a single `**MARKET** ◈ closed — next session: Mon 05-18 09:30 ET (in 2d 16h)` line. Wired into `send_hourly_summary` ONLY (daily-close fires post-bell so the line would always read "tomorrow" — noise), suppressed when the market is currently open (in-session implies trading — the `_capital_pulse_line` FREE/not-bleeding suppression precedent). `next_session_open` is pure / zero-I/O / never raises; walks the weekday + holiday calendar with a 14-day forward bound, and **advances past today** when we are at-or-past 09:30 ET so a mid-session check returns tomorrow's open (never "today 09:30 in the past"); a half-day session is still an open day from this helper's perspective (only the close is early). Observational only, no caps (invariants #2/#12 — the `_host_pulse_line` precedent); `_countdown` clamps negative skew to "in 0m" so a tick of clock drift never renders "in -3m". Locked by `tests/test_core_market.py::TestNextSessionOpen` (9 tests: Fri-close→Mon, Sat/Sun→Mon, pre-open today→today, at-open→tomorrow, mid-session→tomorrow, Thanksgiving skip, Good-Friday weekend+holiday skip, UTC-aware tz tag) and `tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestNextSessionLine` + `TestCountdown` (13 tests: market-open suppression, Fri→Mon countdown, Sat→Mon, pre-market today→30m, holiday skip, helper-never-raises on builder fault, **wired into hourly when closed**, **NOT wired when open**, plus the H:M / D:H bucket shape and negative-clamp)

- `paper_trader/should_restart.py` — **operator CLI** (2026-05-18): one-shot "should I restart this trader right now?" verdict. Composes `/api/supervision` + `/api/runner-heartbeat` + `host_guard.pulse()` into ONE answer printable from a plain shell (mirrors the `python3 -m paper_trader.host_guard` / `python3 -m paper_trader.signals --check-freshness` pattern). State ladder `OK`(exit 0) → `OPS_ONLY`(exit 2; host saturated — restart alone will NOT help, kill out-of-band Opus first) → `RESTART`(exit 1; stale code / wedged loop / Discord dark / lock degraded / dashboard unreachable) → `ERROR`(exit 3; no diagnostic source reachable). **Read-only — never restarts anything**, never writes. Closes the manual-fusion gap an operator hits weekly: three endpoints each diagnose a different facet of the same recurring live pathology and the operator has to consult all three by hand. The pure `build_should_restart` builder consumes already-built verdict dicts (no I/O, never raises — the `_safe` contract); the CLI's `gather()` does degrade-safe HTTP fetches with `host_guard.pulse()` fallback so the command works **when the dashboard is itself down** (which IS a signal — the runner is the most likely cause, so `RESTART` is the correct answer). `--json` for machine consumption (composes in shell guards: `python3 -m paper_trader.should_restart || systemctl --user restart paper-trader`). Locked by `tests/test_should_restart.py` (20 exact-value tests: OK/RESTART/OPS_ONLY/ERROR state ladder, exit-code contract, restart-wins-state-but-ops-action-first ordering, dashboard-unreachable→RESTART, degrade-safe fetch on connection error + garbage payload, --json output)

## Core (live trader) domain

### Architecture & data flow

One cycle of the live trader (`paper_trader/runner.py::_cycle`):

```
runner._cycle()
  └─▶ strategy.decide()
        ├─ market.is_market_open()                      (NYSE hours + 2026 holidays)
        ├─ _portfolio_snapshot(store)                   (mark-to-market every open position)
        ├─ signals.get_top_signals(20, hours=2, ≥4.0)   (live-only DB filter)
        ├─ signals.get_urgent_articles(minutes=30)
        ├─ signals.ticker_sentiments(WATCHLIST, hours=4)
        ├─ market.get_prices(WATCHLIST + futures + ^GSPC)
        ├─ get_quant_signals_live(...)                  (RSI / MACD / BB / momentum, 5-min cached)
        ├─ _build_payload(...) → SYSTEM_PROMPT          (single string)
        ├─ _claude_call(...) → JSON                     (subprocess: claude --print --permission-mode bypassPermissions)
        ├─ _parse_decision(...)                         (strip ```json fences, raw_decode first {…})
        ├─ _enforce_risk_pre_trade(...)                 (only blocks SELL beyond held qty)
        ├─ _execute(...)                                (BUY / SELL / BUY_CALL / BUY_PUT / SELL_CALL / SELL_PUT / HOLD / REBALANCE)
        ├─ store.record_decision(...) / store.record_equity_point(...)
        └─ return summary dict
  └─▶ if FILLED: reporter.send_trade_alert(...) + reporter.send_decision_log(...)
  └─▶ _maybe_hourly() + _maybe_daily_close()
  └─▶ sleep OPEN_INTERVAL_S (1800s) or CLOSED_INTERVAL_S (3600s)
```

`_portfolio_snapshot` is called twice in `decide()` — once before the trade
(input to the prompt) and once after (so the equity_point reflects post-trade
mark-to-market). The two calls keep the DB's `positions_json` and `total_value`
consistent through the cycle.

### How to run the paper trader

```bash
cd /home/zeph/paper-trader

# Foreground (logs to stdout)
python3 -m paper_trader.runner

# Under systemd
systemctl --user start paper-trader   # see paper-trader.service
journalctl --user -fu paper-trader

# Dashboard only (no decision loop)
python3 -c "from paper_trader.dashboard import run; run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8090)"

# Operator CLIs (read-only, plain shell, work when the dashboard is down)
python3 -m paper_trader.should_restart        # one-shot 'should I restart?' verdict (exit 0/1/2/3)
python3 -m paper_trader.host_guard            # 'is the box overloaded right now?' (exit 0/1)
python3 -m paper_trader.signals --check-freshness   # article-DB split-brain detector (exit 0/2/3)
```

The runner starts a daemon thread for the Flask dashboard on `:8090` and
posts a `**PAPER TRADER ONLINE**` ping to Discord on first boot.

The three CLIs above compose into the daily operator loop: `should_restart`
fuses the verdict from the other two with `/api/supervision` + the heartbeat
+ Discord delivery health into a single answer (`OK` / `OPS_ONLY` / `RESTART`
/ `ERROR`). When `RESTART` and `OPS_ONLY` both apply, the OPS action is
listed first — a freshly-booted runner re-starves immediately if you restart
without first reducing concurrent Opus load.

### How to run tests

```bash
cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

All tests are offline — yfinance, Discord, and the digital-intern DB are
mocked. The `tests/conftest.py` autouse fixture redirects backtest paths to
a tmp directory; core tests use their own `fresh_store` fixture that points
`store.DB_PATH` at `tmp_path`.

Core tests live in `tests/test_core_*.py` — one file per module under
review:

| File | What it asserts |
|------|-----------------|
| `test_core_store.py` | cash bookkeeping, position upsert/blend/close, trade & equity ordering |
| `test_core_market.py` | weekend / pre-open / after-close / holiday gating, price-cache TTL, option chain lookup, futures 30s bucket lru_cache, **`get_prices` bulk-download seam** (previously **zero** coverage of the actual `yf.download` branch — only empty/full-cache short-circuits were tested): the load-bearing `len(missing)==1` switch between yfinance's flat-columns single-ticker frame (`data["Close"]`) and the multi-ticker per-ticker MultiIndex (`data[t]["Close"]`) with **real `pandas` frames** (a `MagicMock` would pass even if the branches were swapped), all-NaN-Close → per-ticker `get_price` fallback, missing-ticker-column KeyError → per-ticker fallback, whole-`download`-raises → per-ticker fallback, unresolvable → key present/`None` value, partial-cache fetches only the uncached symbol, full-cache never calls `download`; **`get_options_chain` nearest-DTE seam** (zero prior coverage) — picks the expiry with minimum `abs(date−(today+target_dte))` **even when it is not first listed**, `.head(30)` caps each side, no-expiries → `None`, yfinance-raises → `None` |
| `test_core_signals.py` | top-signal score threshold + sort order, backtest-row filter, urgent ai_score=NULL coercion, ticker regex word-boundary, **single-ticker `get_ticker_sentiment` seam** (a DISTINCT path from the covered bulk `ticker_sentiments` — its own compiled `(?:\$|\b)TKR\b` regex + avg/max/n/urgent aggregation, **zero** prior coverage): no-DB → zeroed dict (never raises), exact `avg_score`/`max_score`/`n`, `urgent` counts only `urgency≥1`, unmentioned ticker → zeroed dict, **"AMDOCS" must not match "AMD"** (the substring-leak regression the bulk path also locks via "MUSE"≠"MU"), `$AMD`-in-body matches, live-only clause excludes `backtest://`/`backtest_*` rows; **`get_ml_predictions` seam** (zero prior coverage; `ml.inference` faked via `sys.modules`, fully offline): import-fail → `[]`, explicit empty input short-circuits before scoring, `None` → `get_top_signals(30,h=6,min=0)` default (sentinel-identity asserted) → empty default → `[]`, `score_articles` raising → `[]`, the `zip(articles, scores)` body **truncates to the shorter** (2 articles + 1 score → 1 row), absent `tickers` key → `[]`, exact field mapping; **`get_historical_signals` gzip-fallback reader** (missing-file → `[]`; strict `< min_score` threshold incl. the `== min_score` KEPT boundary; `score`/`ai_score` `or`-fallback incl. `score:0` → ai_score; `limit` caps the moment `len(out) ≥ limit`; corrupt-JSON / non-numeric-score / blank lines skipped while reading **continues** — a `<`→`<=` or `continue`→`break` regression fails loudly); **freshness-aware `_db_path()` resolver (invariant #15)** — `TestChoosePure` (tie→LOCAL, fresher-local/fresher-usb wins, single-candidate, both-unreadable→LOCAL-first, neither→LOCAL — 6227cd5 LOCAL-first flip), `TestDbPathFreshness` (stale-USB loses to fresh-LOCAL **and** a newer `backtest://` row on USB is excluded from the freshness probe, both-fresh→USB, USB-only, LOCAL-only, candidate-keyed TTL cache), `TestAgeHours` (offset/`Z`/naive/garbage), `TestFeedStatusAndWarn` (split-brain restart signal, all-stale≠split-brain, one-shot WARN dedup), `TestCheckFreshnessCLI` (exit 3/2/0) |
| `test_core_strategy.py` | JSON parse w/ fences + trailing prose, RSI/EMA/MACD math, SELL-exceeds-held blocking, BUY insufficient cash blocking, **ambiguous option close blocking**, **expired-option settlement** (`_option_expired` boundary incl. expiry-day-still-live; `_expired_intrinsic` ITM/OTM/no-underlying; `_portfolio_snapshot` marks expired contracts to intrinsic/0 not premium; live-option transient-None still → avg_cost; `SELL_CALL` on a dead contract settles at intrinsic; **`_portfolio_snapshot` total_value = cash + Σ position market_value across a mixed stock+option book**), **`_stdev_live` population-stdev seam** (`n < 2` → exact `0.0` the `if sd20 > 0` caller-guard relies on; `n=2` computes ÷n not ÷(n-1); constant series → `0.0` via the full variance path; textbook set → exact `2.0` locking `/n` against a `/(n-1)` regression that would silently shift every `bb_position`), **`_format_quant_signals` prompt-block seam** (empty dict → the `(no quant signals available)` sentinel; `_pct` vs `_v` field coercion — momentum/52w use `_pct` "{x}%"/"?", rsi/macd/etc use `_v` no-%; rows `sorted` by ticker so a `.items()` regression can't reorder the prompt non-deterministically) |
| `test_core_runner.py` | `_maybe_daily_close` weekend/time gating + once-per-day flag + retry-on-failure, `_maybe_hourly` 3600s gating + retry-on-failure; **`TestKillStaleClaude`** circuit-breaker pkill is `-P os.getpid()`-scoped (host-wide-broadcast regression lock, invariant #18) **and** still model-anchors Opus+Sonnet; **`TestRunnerStatePersistence`** restart-durable markers (invariant #6) — sidecar IO contract + the no-double-close / no-starved-hourly exact-behaviour locks; **`TestSingletonLock`** single-instance guard (invariant #19) — real `fcntl.flock` acquire/busy/release-on-death/degraded-open + the `main()` busy⇒`SystemExit(1)`-before-`get_store` / degraded⇒continue wiring locks |
| `test_core_runner_cycle.py` | **`_cycle()` report-dispatch fan-out** — previously **zero** direct coverage despite real branching: FILLED gates BOTH trade-alert AND decision-log; HOLD/NO_DECISION/BLOCKED/missing-`status` stay silent **and never query the store** (outer-guard short-circuit asserted via a recording `_FakeStore`); `auto_exits` is an orthogonal `_send` channel independent of the FILLED gate (dead-today-on-purpose per invariant #12 — locked so re-enabling is deliberate, kept per the "do not delete as unreachable" note); the `if trades and status==FILLED` guard (empty `recent_trades(1)` → no alert but decision-log still fires); every reporter fault swallowed (daemon-loop survival, via `monkeypatch` so `boom` can't leak into other modules' reporter import) |
| `test_core_reporter.py` | openclaw missing → False, timeout/nonzero exit → False, trade alert + decision log + portfolio line formatting, **daily-close P/L baseline label tracks `_INITIAL_EQUITY` not a hardcoded `$1000`**, **`send_daily_close` `pnl_real` cash-flow sign (SELL\* credits / BUY\* debits) incl. the option ×100 multiplier via `store.record_trade`** (exact `$-400.00` on a mixed stock+option same-day ledger — a sign flip → `+400.00`, a dropped ×100 → `-449.50`), **`_behavioural_block` composes the scorecard state/headline/focus/concordance verbatim** (no re-derived verdict), suppresses NO_DATA, **returns `""` (never raises) when the builder faults — and `send_hourly_summary`/`send_daily_close` still send the summary regardless** (the "no block, never no summary" failure contract) |
| `test_round_trips.py` | `build_round_trips` arithmetic: simple/partial/re-entry round-trips, option ×100, distinct (ticker,type,strike,expiry) keys, open-lot exclusion, orphan SELL, zero-cost `pnl_pct=None`, negative/unparseable `hold_days`, sub-cent rounding |
| `test_core_analytics.py` | `/api/analytics` end-to-end via Flask test client: exact `win_rate_pct` / `profit_factor` / `avg_holding_days` / `realized_pl_usd` / `n_round_trips` for a fixed ledger; open positions excluded; empty ledger → null metrics |
| `test_core_dashboard_articles_db.py` | Regression lock for invariant #17: `dashboard._articles_db_path()` must resolve through the freshness-aware `signals._db_path()`, not its legacy USB-first existence probe — the discriminating stale-USB-loses-to-fresh-LOCAL assertion, fresher-USB-still-wins, `backtest://`-row excluded from the freshness probe, `None`-when-no-DB (caller contract), and `== signals._db_path()` no-drift |
| `test_core_dashboard_helpers.py` | Pure dashboard helpers with no prior coverage: `_scorer_verdict` 5-way boundary bucketing; `_position_ages_from_trades` open-lot state machine (partial-sell keeps entry, full-sell→re-buy resets, option trades ignored); `_next_market_open` open/close/weekend/holiday arithmetic; `_classify_action` co-pilot selection incl. the **EXIT-before-TRIM** ordering regression and "never BUY without a technical confirm"; **`TestTemplateIdsUnique` — no duplicate static `id="..."` in `dashboard.TEMPLATE`** (regression lock for the `dd-`/`drought-` card-id collision, invariant #14) |
| `test_decision_drought.py` | `build_decision_drought` segmentation: `_classify` fill/block/hold/no-decision; two-drought scenario with exact portfolio/SPY/alpha %; PARALYSIS vs DELIBERATE_HOLD split; ongoing drought detection; `involuntary_alpha_bleed_pct` counts PARALYSIS-only negative alpha; min-reportable-cycles filter; NEVER_TRADED / NO_DATA verdicts; alpha=None when SPY missing |
| `test_news_edge.py` | `build_news_edge`: `_index_at_or_after` exact/gap/overflow; EDGE_CONFIRMED with exact raw means; **SPY-abnormal subtraction is applied** (raw 2.0, spy +1.0 → abnormal 1.0); NO_EDGE on a falling top-band ticker; INSUFFICIENT_DATA under `_MIN_BAND_N`; `$TK`/word-boundary resolution incl. "AMDOCS" must not match AMD; **adaptive reference horizon degrades to 1d when only a 1d forward window exists** (the live-data early-history case) |
| `test_signal_followthrough.py` | `build_signal_followthrough`: exact-value EXPLOITING (acted NVDA+ beats ignored AMD-flat, `selection_edge`/follow-through/per-horizon means) / MISUSING (mirror image, negative edge) / IGNORING_FEED (0% follow-through, ignored-bucket numerics still emitted); **SPY-abnormal subtraction applied** (raw +10 → +8.75 abnormal at 5d under SPY +1/day); per-(decision,ticker) dedup (3 NVDA articles in one window → 1 signal); window boundary (future/stale news excluded); AMDOCS must not match AMD; sample-size honesty (`INSUFFICIENT` keeps numerics, empty → `NO_DATA`); `_fetch_live_articles` excludes planted `backtest://`/`backtest_*`/`opus_annotation*` rows |
| `test_churn.py` | `build_churn`: `NO_DATA`/`EMERGING`/`STABLE` sample-size gate; exact re-entry detection incl. the live NVDA close→re-buy shape (gap_days, `prior_pnl_usd` consumed from `build_round_trips` not recomputed); `REENTRY_WINDOW_DAYS` boundary inclusive **and** one-second-past exclusive; distinct-names→zero re-entries; `reentry_events` sorted fastest-first; both CHURNING paths (≥25% re-entry rate, and fast-cadence with zero re-entries); BUY_AND_HOLD; ACTIVE_TURNOVER between the lines; sub-day loss-concentration exact (= round-trips' own negative-`pnl_usd` sum, single source of truth #10); zero-span book → cadence `None` (no divide-by-zero); all-winners → concentration `None` |
| `test_thesis_drift.py` | `build_thesis_drift`: `NO_DATA` empty; INTACT when up & signals benign; BROKEN via −8% pain line regardless of signals **and** via MACD-flip+negative-mom+loss; WEAKENING via soft −3% loss (no signals), hot RSI while green, cold-catalyst heuristic; **opener selection nearest `opened_at` picks the re-entry lot's BUY not the prior closed lot's** (invariant #8); entry reason surfaced **verbatim** (long string equality); missing ledger → reason `None`, `entry_price` falls back to `avg_cost`, no error; cards sorted worst-first with exact counts |
| `test_loser_autopsy.py` | `build_loser_autopsy`: `_classify` failure-mode precedence (KNIFE_CATCH wins over the fast/shallow WHIPSAW arm, `< FAST_HOLD_DAYS` strict & `>= SLOW_HOLD_DAYS` inclusive boundaries, `None` hold/pnl_pct never raises and defaults); strict `pnl_usd < 0` loser convention (a `pnl==0` wash is **not** a loss — invariant #10); verbatim entry/exit reason joined by trade `id` (first BUY / last SELL; blank/whitespace → `None`, missing-id → `None`, never NLP-parsed); aggregates exact (total/avg, median odd **and** even count, ticker-bleed sorted most-negative-$ first, `repeat_offenders` n≥2, deterministic dominant-mode severity tie-break); P&L/cost/proceeds **consumed from `build_round_trips`** on a partial-then-full close (not recomputed); verdict withheld until `STABLE` (n_losers≥`STABLE_MIN_LOSERS`); NO_DATA/NO_LOSSES/EMERGING honesty; never raises on garbage rows |
| `test_hold_discipline.py` | `build_hold_discipline` — the open-book disposition trap (a loser held past the desk's *own* empirical losing-cut time, caught **while it is still happening**, not in a post-mortem). The discriminating lock is **no-drift**: the reference median is asserted **byte-identical** to `build_loser_autopsy(trades)["median_loser_hold_days"]` (composed verbatim, never re-derived — the `risk_mirror` embedded-headline discipline) **and** independently equal to `statistics.median` over `build_round_trips`' own `pnl_usd<0` holds, so a drift in *either* layer fails loudly; winners excluded from the reference. Strict boundary: `age == median` is **within** discipline, `age == median+ε` is overstayed, a *winner* past the median is **never** overstayed (the `is_losing` gate), an unparseable `opened_at` → `age None`/not flagged/no raise. State ladder `NO_DATA`(no open book)→`INSUFFICIENT`(< `MIN_REFERENCE_LOSERS`=3 closed losers — cards+ages still emitted but **nothing flagged & verdict withheld**, the `loser_autopsy` sample-size precedent)→`DISCIPLINED`→`DISPOSITION_DRAG`; exact `disposition_drag_usd` = Σ of the **overstayed** positions' `unrealized_pl` read **directly** (the option ×100 is already baked into that column — never re-derived from `avg_cost×qty`), `worst_overstayed` = most-negative, overstayed cards sort first deterministically, exact headline format. `_safe`: a monkeypatched `build_loser_autopsy` raising degrades to an honest `INSUFFICIENT`/`reference unavailable` (verdict withheld, `reference_state` `ERROR:…`), **never** an exception (the `event_calendar` contract — a diagnostics fault must not 500 the route or kill the close report); a garbage non-numeric `unrealized_pl` coerces to `0.0`, never raises. `TestEndpoint` drives the real `/api/hold-discipline` Flask view on a fresh temp `Store` (seeded controlled-timestamp losing round-trips + an overstayed open lot) → `DISPOSITION_DRAG` with exact `$-at-risk`. `TestReporterLine`: `_hold_discipline_line` returns `""` on NO_DATA/INSUFFICIENT/fault, emits the builder headline verbatim on `DISPOSITION_DRAG`, and `send_daily_close` still sends the whole report when the builder faults ("no block, never no summary") |
| `test_correlation.py` | `build_correlation`: `_returns` chain (a `0`/NaN/non-numeric bar **breaks then continues** — one bad yfinance bar must not zero the series; `pytest.approx` for the float-division results); `_pearson` exact `±1.0` under a positive/negative affine map, the hand-computed `0.6` fixture, flat-series → `None` (never a fabricated 0), length-mismatch/too-short → `None`; options flagged & skipped; single-name **and** sub-`MIN_RETURNS` series → `INSUFFICIENT` (verdict withheld, numerics where possible); `CONCENTRATED` (identical returns ρ=+1 → `effective_independent_bets`=1.0) / `DIVERSIFIED` (ρ=−1 → eff_bets `None` honest-undefined; constructed ρ=0 → eff_bets 2.0) / `SINGLE_NAME_RISK` overrides correlation when top weight ≥ `DOMINANT_WEIGHT` / `MODERATE` band; `weight_hhi` & `effective_positions_naive` exact (60/40 → HHI 0.52); unequal-length series aligned to the common tail; never raises on garbage |
| `test_risk_mirror.py` | `build_risk_mirror` — the third advisory mirror (concentration + churn) fed into the live prompt. Composes `build_churn`/`build_correlation` **verbatim** (single source of truth #10): the embedded churn headline is asserted **byte-identical** to `build_churn(reversed(trades)).headline` so an inline re-derivation that drifts from `/api/churn` fails loudly. The discriminating lock is **no "verdict withheld" leak**: with empty `price_history` (the live `decide()` path) `build_correlation`'s headline collapses to the bare "correlation verdict withheld" sentence, so the mirror MUST surface the weight-based concentration (`top_weight_pct`/`weight_hhi`/`effective_positions_naive`, all computed from `market_value` regardless of price history) instead — RED if the headline is pasted through. Also: the rich ρ headline **is** used verbatim when real price history makes `state==OK` (CONCENTRATED "moves as one", not the weight-pending fallback); options-only / cash book → concentration line omitted (undefined, not faked); empty book → honest one-line fallback (the self-review precedent), never an empty section; a monkeypatched builder fault degrades to "that line missing", never an exception (the `_safe` contract — a diagnostics fault must not sink a live trading cycle); `_build_payload` renders the block **after** the track-record section and **before** `WATCHLIST PRICES`, and `None` renders no stray text |
| `test_event_calendar.py` | `build_event_calendar` — the forward earnings-awareness block. The discriminating lock is **`days_away` recomputed from `earnings_date` vs injected `now`, not read from the file's stale field** (the file's `days_away` is set to garbage `999.0` in the fixture; a regression that trusts it tiers NVDA wrong → RED). Also: the `HELD_IMMINENT` `<= 3` day boundary is exact (`3.0`→IMMINENT, `3.01`→SOON, the api_earnings rule); an in-play-not-held name is `WATCH`, a neither-held-nor-in-play name is dropped (prompt stays lean); a **past** event (`-1d`) never leaks; a distant `WATCH` (>horizon) is dropped but a distant **held** name's print is always kept; sort is tier-rank then soonest-first; a missing **and** a corrupt file both degrade to an honest non-empty line with `source_ok=False` and **no raise** (the `_safe` contract — a diagnostics fault must not sink a live cycle); `_pick_freshest` picks the newer-`as_of` candidate order-independently and skips unreadable ones; the block carries the autonomy preamble and **no directive verb** (the observational invariant #2/#12 contract); valid-but-empty calendar → honest "no scheduled earnings" line, not a crash; `_build_payload` renders it **after** `risk_mirror` and **before** `WATCHLIST PRICES`, `None` renders no stray text; and `TestEventCalendarEndpoint` drives the real `/api/event-calendar` Flask view on a fresh temp `Store` (held NVDA via `upsert_position`, on-disk snapshot redirected) — route→builder→store wiring returns the imminent tier, not a 404/500 |
| `test_stress_scenarios.py` | `build_stress_scenarios` — the forward beta/concentration shock (day-one complement to the history-gated `tail_risk`). The discriminating locks: **SSOT no-drift** — the −3 % market scenario is asserted equal to an *independent* recompute of `/api/risk`'s `Σ −0.03·β·val` shock (a drift in either fails loudly); **exact hand-computed $** for every family on a pinned 2-name book (an off-by-sign / dropped-β is caught, not "no crash"); **strictly monotone** |loss| −1→−3→−5→−10 %; **option-β path** (×3 cap 4, **negated for puts** — a put book *gains* on a sell-off); **no sample-size gate** (the whole point vs `tail_risk`) verified by an `OK` verdict on a one-position book; `_safe`/`NO_DATA` (empty/None/zero-book/garbage-row/`classify`-raises → honest degrade, never an exception); `_build_payload` renders the block **after** `sector_exposure` and **before** `event_calendar`/`WATCHLIST PRICES`, `None` → no stray text; `TestReporterStressLine` — `_stress_line` is `""` on NO_DATA/fault, emits the builder headline **verbatim** otherwise, and `send_hourly_summary`/`send_daily_close` still send when the builder faults ("no block, never no summary"); `TestStressScenariosEndpoint` drives the real `/api/stress-scenarios` + `/api/analytics` Flask views on a fresh temp `Store` → both equal the builder recomputed with the dashboard's own `_classify`/`_LEVERAGE_BETA` (no hardcoded sector literals → robust to a `SECTOR_MAP` change), empty book → `NO_DATA` not 500; `TestBetaMapIsPinnedToDashboard` pins `_LEVERAGE_BETA == dashboard._LEVERAGE_BETA` and `sector_exposure.classify == dashboard._classify` (the hot-path-no-dashboard-import discipline) |
| `test_recovery.py` | `build_recovery` — the forward "path back to even" (forward complement to the backward `/api/drawdown`). **Exact hand-computed** per-position breakeven %/$ + book to_initial/to_peak %/$ on a pinned underwater book (a sign-flip / dropped figure is caught, not "no crash"); **option breakeven is the raw price ratio, NOT ×100** — an option lot at avg 2.00 / now 1.00 → `+100.0%` (a reviewer multiplying through → `10000.0`, RED — the advisor discriminator); a winner → `0.0` (never negative noise); **σ no-drift** — the σ-day figure recomputed from an independent `annualized_vol_pct/√252` equals the builder's; **dispersion honesty gate** — `tail_risk.state != OK` still emits %/$ but **withholds σ** with the honest sentence *even though the numeric exists* (the young-book precedent), `OK` emits it; state ladder `NO_DATA`/`ABOVE_WATER` (line-suppressed, incl. the empty-book `compute_drawdown` starting-equity fallback)/`UNDERWATER`; garbage rows / None / missing-peak never raise; `TestRecoveryEndpoint` drives the real `/api/recovery` + `/api/analytics` Flask client on a fresh temp `Store` → endpoint == `recovery` fold == builder over the **same** `compute_drawdown`+`build_tail_risk` (no drift), empty book → `ABOVE_WATER` not 500; `TestReporterRecoveryLine` — `""` on NO_DATA/ABOVE_WATER/fault, builder headline **verbatim** on `UNDERWATER`, and `send_hourly_summary` still sends when the builder faults ("no block, never no summary") |
| `test_dashboard_threaded.py` | invariant #7 dashboard-concurrency lock. `test_run_passes_threaded` regression-locks the `dashboard.run` call site (monkeypatched `app.run`): `threaded=True` is passed **and** the existing `debug=False`/`use_reloader=False` hardening is preserved (RED before the 2026-05-17 fix — the kwarg was absent, so the in-process Werkzeug dev server served one request at a time and a single slow yfinance-backed endpoint head-of-line-blocked every concurrent panel / `/api/chat` fan-out / `:8080→:8090` cross-fetch). `test_threaded_server_parallelizes` is the behavioural lock: an independent ephemeral-port `make_server(..., threaded=True)` with a 0.4s route serves 4 concurrent requests in well under the serial 1.6s — so a future swap to a non-threaded WSGI entry point that silently drops the property is caught even though the monkeypatch lock still passes. Offline, deterministic, no real `:8090` bind. Found by user-perspective testing, not code review |

| `test_core_state_swr.py` | `/api/state` stale-while-revalidate + the main-page `refresh()` guard (2026-05-17). End-to-end through the real Flask view on a fresh temp `Store`: cold build returns the full shape + `cached:false`/`cache_age_s` honesty keys; a warm hit within the 15s TTL serves the **stale** payload and does **not** re-read the store even after the underlying portfolio/trades change (the latency win, asserted as behaviour); the documented "inert under pytest unless `_SWR_TEST_FORCE`" contract holds (no honesty keys, live reflection — keeps the other `/api/state`-shaped exact-value tests isolated). `TestRefreshGuard` is a static lock on `dashboard.TEMPLATE` (the `TestTemplateIdsUnique` discipline, comments stripped so it reasons about executable JS): the `/api/state` fetch is wrapped in try/catch and the `!r.portfolio`/`r.warming`/`r.error` early-return precedes the first `r.portfolio.total_value` deref — RED before the fix, when `refresh()` was the lone `refresh*` fn with no guard and any transient `/api/state` body (it has 500'd 28× in prod — the `store.get_portfolio` shared-connection note) froze the whole page |

### Key invariants and constraints

1. **Live trader uses Claude Opus 4.7** — `MODEL = "claude-opus-4-7"` in
   `strategy.py`. The whole prompt is tuned around Opus's reasoning. Do not
   downgrade to Sonnet without an explicit decision.

2. **No hard risk limits** — `_enforce_risk_pre_trade` only checks that a
   SELL doesn't exceed held quantity. There are no position-size, leverage,
   or daily-loss caps. The system prompt grants Opus full autonomy. If a
   reviewer "fixes" this by adding caps, it changes the system's identity —
   discuss before merging.

3. **Live-only DB filter** — every read in `signals.py` against digital-intern's
   `articles.db` includes:
   ```sql
   AND url NOT LIKE 'backtest://%'
   AND source NOT LIKE 'backtest_%'
   AND source NOT LIKE 'opus_annotation%'
   ```
   Mirror this in any new query. The dashboard's `_ticker_news_pulse` already
   does. Forgetting the filter contaminates live signals with the engine's
   own backtest annotations.

4. **Ambiguous option closes are rejected** — when `SELL_CALL` / `SELL_PUT`
   matches more than one open contract and `strike`/`expiry` are unspecified,
   `_execute` returns `BLOCKED` with the open legs in the detail string.
   Picking the "first match" silently could exit the wrong leg.

5. **openclaw env key invariant** — the Discord channel ID lives directly in
   `reporter.DISCORD_CHANNEL`. Do NOT add an env-key dependency or move the
   channel ID into `openclaw.json` — the current setup intentionally hard-codes
   the channel so a missing config doesn't silently route messages elsewhere.

6. **Hourly/daily close idempotence** — `_maybe_hourly` and `_maybe_daily_close`
   only advance their "last sent" markers on actual send success. A transient
   openclaw failure retries on the next cycle rather than silently skipping
   the hour or day. If a reviewer adds a "fire-and-forget" path, this property
   breaks. `_maybe_daily_close` also skips weekends **and** NYSE full-holiday
   closes (`market.NYSE_HOLIDAYS_2026`) — both guards `return` *before* touching
   `_daily_close_sent_for`, so the flag never advances on a non-trading day and
   the next real trading day still gets its close report. Locked by
   `tests/test_core_runner.py::TestMaybeDailyClose` (incl.
   `test_does_not_fire_on_nyse_holiday`).

   **Restart-durable (2026-05-17).** `_daily_close_sent_for` /
   `_last_hourly` were module globals lost on every restart, and the
   runner restarts often (a `/api/build-info` `stale` bounce, systemd,
   the circuit breaker). That broke this invariant *across* a restart in
   two trader-visible ways: a runner bouncing more often than hourly
   **never** sent an hourly summary (every boot re-anchored the 1h
   clock), and a post-16:05 NY restart **double-posted** the DAILY CLOSE.
   Both markers now persist to an **atomic** `data/runner_state.json`
   sidecar (tmp + `os.replace`, every IO swallowed) written on each
   successful send; `main()` rehydrates them *after* the boot-anchor
   default, so a fresh first-ever start is byte-for-byte unchanged while
   a restart restores the real last-hourly instant (an overdue summary
   fires this cycle; a recent one still waits) and the close-sent date
   (no dup). Deliberately a sidecar, **not** a `store.py` table — SCHEMA
   is load-bearing (#13) and this is single-writer best-effort that must
   degrade to today's in-memory-only behaviour, never crash the loop.
   Locked by `tests/test_core_runner.py::TestRunnerStatePersistence`
   (11 tests: IO contract missing/corrupt/non-dict→{}, atomic
   no-leftover-tmp, IO-error swallowed; rehydrate no-sidecar/both/
   corrupt-skip; and the two exact-behaviour bug locks — restart-after-
   close does not double-post, an overdue hourly fires post-restart, a
   <1h one does not). The autouse fixture redirects `_STATE_PATH` to tmp
   so no runner test writes the real sidecar (offline invariant).

7. **`paper_trader.db` uses WAL** — any external reader must use
   `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` or open the file as `file:...?mode=ro` to avoid
   lock contention with the live writer.
   *Dashboard concurrency (doc-truth correction, 2026-05-17 — the prior text
   here said dashboard reads were unlocked / "not strictly connection-safe" /
   "a proper fix would give the dashboard its own read-only connection"; the
   code has since superseded that):* the in-process Flask dashboard runs in a
   daemon thread (`runner._start_dashboard`) and shares the **same** `Store`
   singleton (`sqlite3.Connection`, `check_same_thread=False`) as the runner —
   but **every read now holds `Store._lock`**, not just writes. See the
   load-bearing NOTE at `store.py::Store.get_portfolio` ("every read below
   MUST hold self._lock … shared between the runner's writer thread and the
   Flask dashboard **thread(s)**" — plural). The shared connection is never
   used by two threads at once because `_lock` brackets every `.execute()`;
   the slow yfinance-backed endpoints use their own per-request
   `sqlite3.connect(file:…?mode=ro)`. The store is therefore already hardened
   for a multi-threaded dashboard. **`dashboard.run` now passes
   `threaded=True`** (it previously did not — `app.run` defaults
   `threaded=False`, so the dev server served one request at a time and a
   single slow endpoint head-of-line-blocked every concurrent panel fetch,
   the `/api/chat` ~15-way fan-out, and the `:8080→:8090` cross-fetch behind
   it). Locked by `tests/test_dashboard_threaded.py`. **Per-endpoint latency
   (largely treated):** `threaded=True` removed *cross-request* head-of-line
   blocking; the *per-endpoint* latency concern is now closed by
   `swr_cached` — every slow network endpoint (`/api/correlation`,
   `/api/news-edge`, `/api/source-edge`, `/api/feed-health`,
   `/api/sector-heatmap`, `/api/briefing`, `/api/suggestions`,
   `/api/thesis-drift`, `/api/scorer-predictions`, `/api/data-feed`) **and,
   2026-05-17, the heaviest pure-DB endpoint `/api/state`** (the trader-page
   lifeline — observed 8.7s under concurrent load, the last high-traffic
   gap) is now behind stale-while-revalidate with a bounded cold path. Each
   such cache is its own commit with its own evidence + tests (the
   `/api/state` one is `tests/test_core_state_swr.py`, which also locks the
   `refresh()` warming/error-body guard).

8. **Position uniqueness** — the `positions` table has a *table-wide* UNIQUE
   constraint on `(ticker, type, expiry, strike)` (it is **not** scoped to
   `closed_at IS NULL` — there is no partial index). A second BUY on an
   existing open lot blends the avg_cost; a SELL that zeros out qty marks the
   row closed. A re-BUY after a full close **reactivates the same row** (fresh
   qty/avg_cost/opened_at, marks reset, `closed_at` cleared) — it does *not*
   insert a new row. This is load-bearing: because SQLite treats NULLs as
   distinct in UNIQUE, the old "insert a new row" path only worked for stock
   (NULL strike/expiry); re-entering a previously-closed *option* raised an
   uncaught `IntegrityError` mid-`_execute`, leaving a recorded trade with no
   position and skipping the cash debit + decision/equity write. Locked by
   `tests/test_core_store.py::TestUpsertPosition::test_reopen_option_after_close_does_not_crash`.

9. **Deterministic ordering** — `store.recent_trades`, `recent_decisions`, and
   `equity_curve` order by `(timestamp DESC, id DESC)`. The `id` tiebreaker is
   load-bearing: two writes inside the same microsecond collide on `timestamp`
   alone, and `runner._cycle` reads `recent_trades(1)` immediately after
   `_execute` records a trade — without the tiebreaker `send_trade_alert` could
   post a stale same-microsecond row. `equity_curve` still returns ascending
   `{timestamp,total_value,cash,sp500_price}` (no `id` leaked to callers).
   Locked by `tests/test_core_invariants.py::TestSameTimestampOrdering`.

10. **Round-trip aggregation has one home** — `paper_trader/analytics/round_trips.py::build_round_trips`
   is the single source of truth for closed-round-trip P&L (a round-trip is the
   slice of same-`(ticker,type,strike,expiry)` trades from qty-leaves-zero to
   qty-returns-zero; a re-BUY after a full close starts a new one). `analytics_api`
   (`/api/analytics`) consumes it for `win_rate_pct` / `profit_factor` /
   `avg_holding_days`; do **not** reintroduce an inline copy here or in a future
   trade-attribution endpoint — they drift. `pnl_usd` is rounded to 4dp and the
   win/loss split is strict `> 0`, so a sub-cent artefact reads as a non-win
   (pinned by `tests/test_round_trips.py::TestEdgeCases::test_subcent_pnl_rounds_to_zero`).
   The `/api/backtests/compare` win-rate is a **different** metric (per-fill FIFO
   lot win/loss, stocks only) and intentionally does *not* use this helper.

11. **Scorer honesty is end-to-end** — every panel that surfaces a
   DecisionScorer prediction calls `predict_with_meta()` (never the bare
   scalar `predict()`) and propagates `off_distribution` +
   `raw_pred_5d_return_pct`: `/api/scorer-predictions`, `/api/position-thesis`
   (→ thesis card → unified conviction board), `/api/disagreement`,
   `/api/scorer-confidence`. A clamped ±50 floor must never reach a UI/board
   without its low-trust flag, or a phantom "confident EXIT" pins downstream
   conviction. Locked by `tests/test_scorer_honesty.py`. **The on-disk clamp
   is necessary but not sufficient: a long-running `:8090` process that
   booted before the clamp commit keeps extrapolating to ±700% in memory.**
   `/api/build-info` (`stale: true`) is the canonical signal that a restart
   is required to apply committed scorer/code fixes; locked by
   `tests/test_build_info.py`. **The `:8090` trader page now carries an
   always-on, page-wide red banner** (`#global-stale-banner`, polls
   `/api/build-info` every 60s; new 2026-05-16) that fires whenever
   `stale` **or** `behind > 0` — previously only the unified landing page
   and per-panel `fetchMaybeStale` degradation surfaced this, so a stale
   trader (e.g. the self-review mirror silently not injected, the exact
   live state on 2026-05-16) was invisible from the trader page itself.
   It is purely informational — it changes no behaviour and adds no caps.

12. **One source of truth for the $1000 baseline** — every starting-equity /
   P&L-% denominator must read `store.INITIAL_CASH`, never a hardcoded
   `1000.0`. `reporter._INITIAL_EQUITY`, `dashboard.portfolio_api`
   (`starting_value`), and `dashboard.analytics_api` (Calmar's
   `total_return_pct`) all reference the constant. A literal silently
   desyncs the moment `INITIAL_CASH` moves (fixed in `reporter.py`,
   commit `2a154df`; the analytics Calmar leak fixed in this pass). The
   backtest-side `1000.0` in `backtest_compare`'s empty-curve fallback is a
   *separate* baseline (`backtest.py`'s own `INITIAL_CASH`) and is out of
   scope of this rule. Locked by
   `tests/test_core_analytics.py::TestCalmarBaseline`.

13. **Expired options settle at intrinsic, never at premium** — yfinance has
   no option chain past expiry, so `market.get_option_price` returns `None`
   for a held-to-expiry contract. The old `cur = cur or p["avg_cost"]` in
   `strategy._portfolio_snapshot` then marked a (usually worthless) expired
   contract at its full purchase premium **forever**, never closing it —
   silently inflating `total_value` and every reported P/L. The system
   prompt explicitly tells Opus it "can hold options through expiry", so
   this is reachable *by design*, not an accident. Fixed at two sites:
   `_portfolio_snapshot` (the mark) and `_execute`'s `SELL_CALL`/`SELL_PUT`
   close path. Both now route an expired contract through
   `strategy._expired_intrinsic(ticker, otype, strike)` =
   `max(0, underlying−strike)` (call) / `max(0, strike−underlying)` (put),
   falling back to **0.0** (never avg_cost) when the underlying price is
   unavailable. The `or`→`is not None` change on the mark fallback is
   load-bearing: a legitimate `0.0` intrinsic must survive, and `0.0 or
   avg_cost` would clobber it straight back to premium. `_option_expired`
   uses `<` (an option is live *on* its expiry date).
   **This is a *valuation* fix, not a risk limit.** It does not violate the
   "no hard risk limits / Opus has full autonomy" invariant (#2) — that
   invariant governs *gating decisions*, not *valuing instruments*. Do not
   read this as an autonomy violation and revert it. Full auto-settlement
   (recording a synthetic SELL + closing the row at expiry) was
   *deliberately deferred*: it would make `_portfolio_snapshot` state-
   mutating for every caller (it is currently a pure mark), which is too
   invasive for a surgical pass and risks the parse-retry tests that
   monkeypatch it. The conservative fix removes the phantom-equity harm; an
   expired contract simply marks to its true value and stays an open row
   until Opus closes it (and closing it now also settles correctly). The
   live `paper_trader.db` has had **zero** option positions to date, so
   this is latent, not active — but the bug is real code-path and the test
   suite locks the desired behaviour. Locked by
   `tests/test_core_strategy.py::TestOptionExpired` /
   `::TestExpiredIntrinsic` / `::TestPortfolioSnapshotExpiredOptions` /
   `::TestExecuteCloseExpiredOption`.

14. **`dashboard.TEMPLATE` element IDs must be globally unique** — every
   panel is a separate card in one giant HTML document, and the JS drives
   them with bare `getElementById("…")`, which resolves to the *first*
   element in document order. Two cards sharing an id ⇒ one panel silently
   writes into the other's DOM. This actually happened: the **Decision
   drought drift** card (2026-05-16) reused the **Drawdown anatomy** card's
   (2026-05-15) `dd-` prefix, so `id="dd-card"`/`id="dd-current"` each
   appeared twice — `refreshDecisionDrought()` wrote its status into the
   drawdown card's "current equity" stat and the drought card's own status
   box stayed stuck on "loading…" forever. Fixed by renaming the *newer*
   (intruding) card to a `drought-*` namespace; the original `dd-*` owner
   is left untouched. When you add a card, pick a fresh id prefix — don't
   extend a neighbour's. Locked by
   `tests/test_core_dashboard_helpers.py::TestTemplateIdsUnique`
   (`test_no_duplicate_static_element_ids` would have failed pre-fix).

15. **`signals._db_path()` is freshness-aware, not existence-first.** It was
   `if USB_DB.exists(): return USB_DB` since the initial commit — but the
   digital-intern daemon falls back to writing the **LOCAL** copy when the USB
   mount is unavailable for writes, leaving a USB mirror that keeps
   `exists()`-ing while going day-stale. The live trader then read frozen news
   while every other surface (daemon, unified dashboard — both LOCAL-first)
   read the fresh DB. ~24 builders/endpoints *detected* this split-brain
   (`/api/feed-health`, chat fallbacks) but none root-fixed it. `_db_path()`
   now picks the candidate whose newest **live** article (`_LIVE_ONLY_SQL` —
   so a fresh batch of injected `backtest://` rows on a stale mirror can't win
   it) is most recent; LOCAL is preferred on a tie / when freshness is
   indeterminate (LOCAL is the live daemon's write path — 6227cd5 flipped
   this from the old USB-first default). TTL-cached (120s,
   keyed on the candidate tuple so a monkeypatching test always re-resolves);
   a one-shot stderr WARN fires when the chosen feed is ≥6h stale. **This is a
   data-sourcing fix, not a risk limit — invariants #2/#12 untouched (same
   reasoning as the #13 valuation fix).** **It does not rescue a running
   process:** a `:8090`/runner that booted pre-fix keeps the old resolver and
   reads USB until restart (`/api/build-info` `stale`). New operator CLI
   `python3 -m paper_trader.signals --check-freshness` (offline, no Flask —
   works even when the stale process makes every detector endpoint 404):
   prints each candidate's newest-live age + the freshest/legacy picks, exits
   `3` split-brain (a stale process is blind — RESTART) / `2` whole pipeline
   stale (restart won't help — fix the daemon) / `0` healthy. `feed_status()`
   is the reusable snapshot behind it. Resolver mirrored into digital-intern's
   **vendored** `paper_trader/signals.py` (port-only-the-change rule, Cross-
   system contract); parity locked by digital-intern's
   `tests/test_paper_trader_signals_isolation.py`. Locked by
   `tests/test_core_signals.py` (`TestChoosePure` tie/fresher/single/fallback
   matrix · `TestDbPathFreshness` end-to-end incl. backtest-row exclusion &
   candidate-keyed cache · `TestAgeHours` · `TestFeedStatusAndWarn` ·
   `TestCheckFreshnessCLI` exit codes). Consequence for `/api/feed-health`
   (next bullet).

16. **`/api/feed-health` split-brain is now legacy-vs-fresh.** Because #15
   made `_db_path()` resolve the *fresh* DB, the old "the **resolved** DB is
   stale while a fresher candidate exists" shape can no longer fire for a
   current-code process — that detector would have gone silently dead. The
   endpoint now also passes `signals._legacy_choice()` (the old existence-
   first pick — what a *stale running process* still reads) as `feed[
   "legacy_path"]`/`legacy_newest`; `build_feed_health` flags `split_brain`
   when that legacy pick differs from the fresh resolution and is ≥
   `SPLIT_BRAIN_GAP_H` staler (a pre-fix/stale process is blind → `restart_
   recommended`). The **pure** builder's original `resolved_stale_split` term
   is retained verbatim and is inert unless `legacy_path` is supplied, so the
   four `tests/test_feed_health.py::TestSplitBrain` exact-value fixtures stay
   green **untouched** (proof the locked invariant didn't actually conflict).
   New output keys `legacy_path` / `legacy_newest_age_h`. Only the
   *endpoint* test (`tests/test_feed_health_endpoint.py::test_endpoint_flags_
   blind_split_brain`) changed — its old assertions
   `resolved_path.endswith("usb_…")` literally codified the bug; corrected to
   the post-fix fresh `local_…` + the new `legacy_*` fields (a correction,
   not a weakened test).

17. **`dashboard._articles_db_path()` delegates to `signals._db_path()`.** It
   was the last un-fixed instance of the #15 split-brain: its own legacy
   USB-first existence probe (`if usb.exists(): return usb`) while its
   docstring *claimed* to "Match how paper_trader.signals discovers the
   digital-intern articles.db". So `/api/news-edge`, `/api/source-edge`,
   `/api/signal-followthrough`, `/api/sector-pulse` (via `_ticker_news_pulse`)
   read the **stale USB mirror** while the live trader read the fresh LOCAL
   one — the same documented split-brain, surviving in this one helper. It now
   calls `signals._db_path()` (the freshness-aware single source of truth) and
   returns `None` when the resolved DB does not exist, **preserving the caller
   contract** (`if path is None: <graceful>`) — `signals._db_path()` returns
   LOCAL_DB as its tie/fallback even when nothing exists, so the `.exists()`
   gate is load-bearing. Data-sourcing fix, not a risk limit (invariants
   #2/#12 untouched — same reasoning as #15). Like #15 it does **not** rescue
   a running process: a stale `:8090` keeps the old probe until restart
   (`/api/build-info` `stale`). Locked by
   `tests/test_core_dashboard_articles_db.py`
   (`TestArticlesDbPathIsFreshnessAware` — the discriminating
   stale-USB-loses-to-fresh-LOCAL assertion, fresher-USB-still-wins,
   backtest-row-excluded, `None`-when-missing, and the
   `== signals._db_path()` no-drift lock).

18. **The auto-recovery circuit breaker is scoped to the runner's own
   children.** `runner._kill_stale_claude()` (fired after
   `CONSECUTIVE_NO_DECISION_LIMIT`=5 NO_DECISION cycles) used to run a
   **host-wide** `pkill -f "claude --model claude-opus"` /
   `claude-sonnet`. On this multi-agent box that ERE also matches the
   hourly self-review agents (`scripts/hourly_review.sh` spawns 3×
   `claude --model claude-opus-4-7`), sibling automated-review agents,
   and any operator interactive `claude` session — so a wedged trader
   recovering would SIGTERM **every** Claude process on the machine,
   including the agents that keep the system healthy and one that may
   have just deployed a fix. It is now scoped with
   `pkill -P os.getpid()`: the decision subprocess is always a *direct*
   child of the runner, so `-P` restricts the sweep to exactly what the
   breaker is meant to reap. The model-anchored `claude --model <family>`
   pattern (Opus first, Sonnet fallback — never a bare `claude --print`
   that matches nothing) is **preserved unchanged**. This is a
   collateral-damage fix, not a risk limit (invariants #2/#12 untouched).
   Locked by `tests/test_core_runner.py::TestKillStaleClaude`
   (`test_kill_is_scoped_to_own_child_processes` — RED on a regression
   back to host-wide `["pkill","-f",pattern]`; the prior
   `assert argv[:2]==["pkill","-f"]` literally codified the broadcast
   bug, corrected not weakened, the invariant-#16 precedent;
   pattern-anchoring Opus+Sonnet assertions kept verbatim).

19. **One runner per paper book — the single-instance guard.** Two
   concurrent `runner.py` processes on the same `paper_trader.db` is a
   real, *observed* live pathology (2026-05-17: an orphaned manual launch
   under PID 1 **and** the systemd-managed instance both cycling, so a
   trader saw 2–3 decisions clustered inside a minute then an hour of
   nothing — double-trades, doubled concurrent-`claude` RAM, a raced
   decision/equity log). Nothing in `runner.py` prevented it
   (digital-intern's daemon has a singleton lock; this was the missing
   twin). `main()` now calls `_acquire_singleton_lock()` **first** —
   before `get_store()`, the dashboard thread, or the ONLINE ping — an
   `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)` advisory lock on
   `data/paper_trader.runner.lock`. `flock` is the robust primitive: the
   **kernel releases it when the holder dies** (crash / SIGKILL / normal
   exit), so a restart never trips over a stale PID file — the exact
   failure a naive pid-file guard introduces. The locked fd is retained
   in the module global `_SINGLETON_LOCK_FH` for process life (closing it
   frees the lock). Three outcomes: `acquired` (hold it, write our PID
   into the file for `cat`-ability), `busy` (another **live** process
   holds it → log the holder PID and `sys.exit(1)` — the *only*
   fail-closed path; a second trader must not even mark-to-market the
   shared book), `degraded` (no `fcntl` / unwritable dir / USB unmounted →
   **continue WITHOUT the guard** and warn — never take down the *sole*
   runner over lock plumbing, the `_save_runner_state` best-effort
   philosophy). **This is a safety guard, not a risk limit** — it gates
   *process startup*, not trading decisions; invariants #2/#12 untouched
   (same reasoning as #13/#15). Like every recent feature it **applies on
   the next paper-trader restart** — it does NOT kill an already-running
   duplicate (an operator must stop the orphan; the guard prevents
   *recurrence*). Locked by `tests/test_core_runner.py::TestSingletonLock`
   (real `fcntl.flock` on a tmp lockfile — a second `open()`+`flock` in
   the same process contends exactly as a second process would: first
   acquire writes the PID; second is `busy` with the holder PID;
   close→reacquire proves no stale-lock-blocks-restart; a file-as-parent
   path degrades open-not-closed; and the two `main()` wiring locks —
   `busy`⇒`SystemExit(1)` *before* `get_store`, `degraded`⇒continues).

   **Degraded self-recheck (2026-05-18, commit `7aa4d85`).** The boot-time
   `degraded` fail-open left a real hole: a runner that booted while the
   USB-backed `data/` dir was transiently unmounted ran guard-less
   *forever*, so a later runner cleanly took the flock and **both
   double-traded** (confirmed live: PID 1255030 no lock fd + PID 1465599
   holds `FLOCK …265831`; `/api/decision-reliability` 27.6% `TIMEOUT_EMPTY`,
   −2.21% involuntary alpha bleed). `_recheck_singleton_lock()` now runs at
   the top of every loop iteration and re-attempts the lock **only from the
   `degraded` state**: `acquired`→upgrade in place (keep the handle);
   `busy`→`sys.exit(1)` (another live trader **confirmed** holding it — the
   redundant degraded runner stands down); still `degraded`→keep running.
   **Invariant #19 is fully preserved: it exits ONLY on a confirmed other
   holder, NEVER on plumbing failure** (a USB flap during normal operation
   must not kill the sole trader). Hard **no-op once `acquired`** — a 2nd
   `open()`+`flock` of the same file in the same process is denied by our
   *own* lock and would mis-read as `busy`, exiting the real holder (the
   load-bearing guard). This is **cooperative self-introspection, not PID
   hunting / a host-wide scan** — no signal is sent to any other process;
   the runner inspects only *its own* lock and *itself* exits. So the guard
   now also self-heals an *already-running* degraded duplicate (within one
   cycle of the lock holder existing), narrowing — though not eliminating
   (a never-locked runner predating this code still needs an operator
   stop) — the "does NOT kill an already-running duplicate" caveat above.
   `runner.singleton_lock_state()` exposes `{status, holder_pid, have_lock,
   degraded}` for `/api/runner-heartbeat` (`singleton_lock` block) and the
   hourly/daily Discord summary (`⚠️ RUNNER DEGRADED`) so a guard-less
   runner self-reports. Locked by
   `tests/test_core_runner.py::TestRecheckSingletonLock`.

20. **NEVER call `store._connect()` from a test.** Even when a fixture
   monkeypatches `store.DB_PATH`, `_connect()` reads `DB_PATH` at call
   time from the module global — fine in principle — but if your test
   bypasses the established `fresh_store` fixture (see
   `tests/test_news_velocity.py:325` for the canonical pattern that
   first monkeypatches `store.DB_PATH = tmp_path / "paper_trader.db"`
   *then* instantiates `Store()`) and calls `_connect()` directly with
   no path redirection, it opens the **LIVE** `data/paper_trader.db`.
   Any DDL/DML the test runs (`DELETE FROM decisions`, schema add, etc.)
   then **silently wipes production data**. Caught live 2026-05-19 by
   the very review pass adding `tests/test_blocked_repeats.py` — a
   `_FreshStore` stub called `_connect()` it did not actually use and
   the subsequent `DELETE FROM decisions` truncated 96 rows of historical
   decisions before the bug was noticed (trades/positions/equity_curve
   untouched; the rogue DELETE was scoped to one table). Two compliant
   patterns:
     - **Reuse the canonical fixture** — depend on `fresh_store`
       (`tmp_path` + `monkeypatch(store.DB_PATH, …)` + `Store()`); see
       `test_news_velocity.py` / `test_news_source_mix.py`.
     - **Pure stub** — when the endpoint only reads (`recent_decisions`,
       `open_positions`, …), back the stub with a Python list and skip
       sqlite entirely. See
       `tests/test_blocked_repeats.py::TestEndpoint._setup_app`.
   If you must touch sqlite directly, monkeypatch `store.DB_PATH` first
   and the autouse `_isolate_data_dir` fixture in `conftest.py` should
   handle the rest. The autouse fixture deliberately does NOT redirect
   `store.DB_PATH` (that's owned by `fresh_store`), so a stray
   `_connect()` slips past it.

### Dashboard API endpoints (port 8090)

All endpoints serve `application/json`. CORS is wide open (`*`) so the
Digital Intern dashboard on `:8080` can cross-fetch.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /` | HTML — live trader page (portfolio + trades + chart) |
| `GET /backtests` | HTML — backtest grid + equity overlay |
| `GET /api/state` | Portfolio + positions + last 40 trades + last 20 decisions + equity curve. **`swr_cached("state", 15.0)` (2026-05-17):** this is the trader page's lifeline (polled every 15s by `refresh()`, cross-fetched, observed bursting 2–5 req/s) and the heaviest pure-DB read — six lock-held `Store` reads + a ~145KB body (eq 5000 + 500 trades). It was measured at **8.7s under concurrent load** and was the *only* high-traffic core endpoint not behind `swr_cached` while every slow network endpoint already was (the invariant #7 gap). The portfolio only changes on a decision cycle (`OPEN_INTERVAL_S` ≥ 1800s) so a 15s stale-while-revalidate window is invisible to a trader, serves instantly from the last good payload, single-flight-refreshes in the background, and the runner already pushes every fill to Discord immediately. Injected `cached`/`cache_age_s` honesty keys. `refresh()` tolerates the SWR cold `{"warming":true}` placeholder (skips the tick, self-heals next poll). Locked by `tests/test_core_state_swr.py` |
| `GET /api/portfolio` | Compact portfolio read (consumed by Digital Intern at :8080) |
| `GET /api/data-feed` | Live news-collector pulse — proxies digital-intern's `articles.db` (live-only filter): articles in last 1h / 24h + top active sources. Returns zeros (with `error`) if the article DB is unreachable so the widget still renders |
| `GET /ticker/<sym>` | HTML — **standalone per-ticker drill-down page** (2026-05-18). Deliberately NOT a new tab in the 9k-line SPA `TEMPLATE` (so it can't merge-conflict that file); a self-contained dark page that fetches `/api/ticker/<sym>` client-side. Has a ticker box to jump between names; links honour `X-Forwarded-Prefix` so it works behind the `:8888` proxy. |
| `GET /api/ticker/<sym>` | **Cross-system dossier for one name** — fuses the live lot + marks, the closed round-trip P&L *for that name only*, the Opus decision trail that touched it, and the live news flow + sentiment. Closes the "inspecting MU means crossing three surfaces by hand" gap. Pure SSOT `analytics/ticker_dossier.py::build_ticker_dossier` (no DB handle / no network / no yfinance — only stored marks + the read-only `signals` reads that already self-degrade on a locked feed). **Intentionally NOT `@swr_cached`:** that decorator keys on the query string only, so a `<sym>` *path* param would collide across tickers (serve MU's dossier for NVDA); the endpoint is lighter than the un-cached `/api/portfolio` peer so the hot path stays bounded without SWR. `has_coverage:false` ⇒ nothing on file anywhere (typo'd ticker shows a clean empty state, not an error). Locked by `tests/test_ticker_dossier.py` (exact aggregates) + `tests/test_ticker_endpoint.py` (Flask test client, incl. a two-ticker no-collision regression) |
| `GET /api/watchlist-opportunities` | **Missed-opportunity radar** (2026-05-18) — watchlist names with live news heat that the book has **no position in**. Orthogonal to every existing position-centric panel (drawdown / track-record / thesis-drift all describe what's held; this answers "what is the news screaming about that I have zero exposure to?"). One `get_top_signals` fetch; the pure SSOT `analytics/watchlist_opportunities.py::build_watchlist_opportunities` tallies per ticker (no N-query fan-out). `heat = max_score·(1+ln(1+n)/3)·(1+0.25·urgent)`. `@swr_cached("watchlist-opportunities", 60.0)` (no path param, safe to cache). Locked by `tests/test_watchlist_opportunities.py` (exact heat arithmetic + held-exclusion) |
| `GET /api/validation` | Signal-integrity validation history (permutation tests + label audits) read from `data/validation_results.json`, appended by the continuous loop's background validation runner (capped 50 on the writer side); UI renders the most recent entry |
| `GET /api/backtests` | Full backtest run list with SPY/QQQ baselines |
| `GET /api/backtests/<run_id>` | Single backtest detail (trades, decisions, equity) |
| `GET /api/backtests/compare?ids=1,2,3` | Normalized overlay of 2–4 runs |
| `GET /api/backtests/<run_id>/trades` | Trades for a single backtest run |
| `GET /api/backtests/<run_id>/decisions` | Decisions for a single backtest run |
| `GET /api/model-progress` | Per-cycle aggregated returns for the Model Progress chart |
| `GET /api/analytics` | Sector exposure, Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, win rate, profit factor, beta, drawdown |
| `GET /api/sector-pulse` | Semis-focused card: price, RSI, vol_ratio, top headline per ticker |
| `GET /api/risk` | Concentration, leveraged exposure, position ages, SPY-shock estimate |
| `GET /api/briefing` | Pre-market / live briefing: futures, next-open countdown, urgent news |
| `GET /api/suggestions` | Trade-idea cards: BUY / ADD / TRIM / EXIT / WATCH per ticker |
| `GET /api/greeks` | Per-leg and portfolio-wide Black-Scholes Greeks |
| `GET /api/scorer-predictions` | DecisionScorer 5d-return predictions per held stock (clamped; `off_distribution` + `raw_pred_5d_return_pct` flag extrapolation) |
| `GET /api/sector-heatmap` | DRAM/semis sector heatmap with momentum + news pulse |
| `GET /api/sector-signal-fit` | **Are you allocated where the wire is pointing?** — per-sector position weight vs. live-signal-density divergence. `/api/sector-exposure` shows position concentration; `/api/news-deduped`/`/api/signals` show what the wire is talking about. Neither answers the discretionary-PM question: am I overweight a sector the wire has moved on from, or underweight one where coverage is accelerating? Composes `build_sector_exposure(snap, names)` (single source of truth — no re-derived position weights) with a sector-weighted ai_score rollup of the last `?hours=` (default 6) of live signals (`signals.get_top_signals`, the same window the trader sees). A multi-sector signal **splits weight evenly across mentioned sectors** (so a 4-ticker SEMIS article contributes ONCE to SEMIS, not 4× — discriminator vs. a naive per-mention sum that would distort the share); a signal with zero extracted tickers contributes nothing (counted separately as `n_signals_with_no_tickers` for honesty, never absorbed as "other-sector noise"). Per-sector verdicts (precedence): `OVERWEIGHT` (`gap_pct > +gap_threshold_pct`, default ±15 — long but wire is quiet, de-risk candidate) / `UNDERWEIGHT` (`gap_pct < −threshold` — wire is loud but no position, lean-in candidate) / `ALIGNED`. Top-level `state` ∈ `ALIGNED`/`MISALIGNED`/`NO_DATA` (ALIGNED iff every sector within threshold). `signal_share_pct` ALWAYS sums to ~100.0 across surfaced sectors (the denominator is total weighted ai_score — never a fabricated fraction that doesn't add up). Sector classification reuses `analytics.sector_exposure.classify` (the verbatim mirror of `dashboard._classify`, drift-locked) so the position-side and signal-side columns share one SECTOR_MAP. Rows sorted descending by `\|gap_pct\|`, ties by sector name (worst-divergence first). Knobs echoed in the response (`window_hours`, `min_score`, `gap_threshold_pct`, `n_signals_input`) so the payload is self-describing. **Advisory only — never gates Opus, never fed into the decision prompt** (invariants #2/#12; observational sibling to `/api/sector-exposure` which IS in the prompt — this one stays dashboard/chat-side only). Pure core: `analytics/sector_signal_fit.py::build_sector_signal_fit` (never raises; bad inputs degrade to `NO_DATA` or empty rows). Locked by `tests/test_sector_signal_fit.py` (27 tests: signal-share-sums-to-100, multi-sector-single-contribution, cross-sector-split, no-tickers-counted-separately, zero/negative-score-dropped, unknown→other, ranking, threshold flip, NO_DATA/MISALIGNED honesty, garbage-rows-degrade, Flask end-to-end). Applies on next paper-trader restart (`/api/build-info` `stale`) |
| `GET /api/news-deduped` | Top signals after dedup + exponential urgency decay |
| `GET /api/position-thesis` | Per-position cards combining scorer + technicals + news + last decision. Each card carries `off_distribution` + `raw_pred_5d_return_pct` so the unified conviction board can decay its ML axis off the explicit flag (not a re-derived magnitude heuristic) |
| `GET /api/position-runrate` | **Per-position P/L pace + verdict — "is this position bleeding faster than I'd tolerate, or actually working?"** The complementary, *pace*-first view to `/api/position-thesis` (verdict-from-scorer) and `/api/hold-discipline` (aggregate-disposition). Returns per-position `runrate_per_day_usd` (= `unrealized_pl / hold_days`), `annualized_pct` (= `pl_pct × 365/hold_days`), `projected_pl_30d_usd`, plus an aggregate book-wide pace headline and a `worst_runrate` pointer. Verdict bands key off **annualized return %** so a $1000 book and a $100000 book read the same scale: BLEEDING (≤ −100%/yr), FLAT (in band), WORKING (≥ +25%/yr), FRESH (< 1h hold — slope dominated by intraday noise), UNKNOWN (stale mark — price unavailable, verdict withheld). Pure arithmetic over `store.open_positions()` + `portfolio.total_value` — NO network, NO extra store reads (the `risk_mirror` hot-path discipline). The endpoint joins `opened_at` from the open-positions table into the persisted `positions_json` snapshot since the snapshot strips that field on persist. Observational only — never gates Opus (invariants #2/#12), never injected into the decision prompt. Pure core: `analytics/position_runrate.py::build_position_runrate` (never raises). Locked by `tests/test_position_runrate.py` (16 tests: per-day-pace math, annualized verdict bands, stale-mark yields UNKNOWN not falsely FLAT, sub-1h fill yields FRESH not noise-driven BLEEDING, future opened_at clamps to zero, options ×100 multiplier in book-weight math, aggregate sums only valid rows, headline composition). Applies on next paper-trader restart (the documented stale pattern — `/api/build-info` `stale`/`behind`) |
| `GET /api/calibration` | Confidence-bucket win rate + signal-source attribution |
| `GET /api/drawdown` | Drawdown anatomy: peak/trough, time-in-DD, per-position contribution |
| `GET /api/benchmark` | **"Is this bot worth running vs just buying the index?"** — the trader's *first* question, with no home until now. Whole-account return (cash + open + every realised round-trip + unrealised mark) since the first equity write vs the **identical starting capital invested once in the S&P 500 at that same instant and held untouched**. The figure is the `^GSPC` *index level* recorded on every `equity_curve` write from cycle one (~7400 — **not** the SPY ETF; the module says "S&P 500" everywhere, never "SPY", so a 7400 mark is never mislabelled $620). **Distinct from its neighbours — do not "consolidate" (invariant #10):** `/api/open-attribution` is per-**open**-lot alpha *since each lot's entry* (blind to realised P&L / cash drag, resets per re-opened lot, invariant #8); `/api/analytics` `sp500_beta` is a *statistical regression* needing many daily points (`null` on the live book). This is the full-account dollar answer, defined from cycle 1, no regression, no per-lot windowing. Outputs `port_return_pct`/`sp500_return_pct`/`alpha_pp`, `sp500_equivalent_usd`, `usd_vs_sp500`, `pct_cycles_ahead`, running best-lead/worst-lag extremes + a down-sampled (≤200, last point always pinned — strictly bounded, unlike `drawdown.py`'s `+[hist[-1]]` which can overshoot to 201) cumulative-alpha `history`. Sample-size honest like `news_edge`/`trade_asymmetry`: `NO_DATA` (no row with both a value and an S&P mark) → `INSUFFICIENT` (< `_MIN_SPAN_HOURS`=24h **or** < `_MIN_POINTS`=12 benchmarkable points — numerics emitted, **verdict withheld**) → `OK` with verdict `BEATING`/`LAGGING`/`TRACKING` (`\|alpha\|` ≤ `_TRACK_BAND_PP`=0.5pp → TRACKING). The inception anchor is the **first row carrying both a value and an S&P mark** (yfinance cold-start robustness), not blindly `equity_curve[0]`. `headline` is the single source of truth the endpoint, the **`python -m paper_trader.analytics.benchmark [--json]` CLI** (the `desk_pulse`/`signals --check-freshness` precedent — answers from a terminal when `:8090` is wedged/slow; verified live while `/api/state` was timing out) and the Discord line all render verbatim so they can never drift. Endpoint passes the module `INITIAL_CASH` (invariant #12, never a literal 1000). Advisory only — never gates Opus, adds no caps, **not** injected into the decision prompt (invariants #2/#12; the `desk_pulse`/`self_review` observational precedent). Pure core: `analytics/benchmark.py::build_benchmark` (never raises — a malformed row degrades, the contract is "no benchmark this cycle", never an exception). Locked by `tests/test_benchmark.py` (hand-computed BEATING/LAGGING/TRACKING + the **real 2026-05-17 live-book shape** `^GSPC 7444.88→7409.18`, $1000→$972.69 → `−2.25pp / −$22.52` arithmetic lock; NO_DATA/INSUFFICIENT honesty; first-usable-anchor robustness; invariant #12 init=2000 lock; never-raises-on-garbage; history strictly ≤200; reporter line composes the headline verbatim & a builder fault drops only its line while the hourly summary still sends; endpoint e2e via the Flask test client cross-checked equal to the builder on the same store). **Reporter:** `reporter._benchmark_line` appends a `**BENCHMARK** ◈ vs S&P 500 buy-and-hold` block to the hourly + daily-close summaries (composed verbatim, `NO_DATA` suppressed, same "no block, never no summary" failure contract as `_session_block`/`_behavioural_block`). Applies on next paper-trader restart (the documented pattern for every recent feature) |
| `GET /api/earnings-risk` | Upcoming earnings ⨯ held positions / watchlist, tiered (network-sourced from `:8080`; dashboard view, exposure-$ weighted) |
| `GET /api/event-readiness` | **Will the live trader actually be able to react before the next earnings print?** `/api/earnings-risk` says NVDA reports in 16h, `/api/decision-drought` says the bot is in a 4.7h PARALYSIS streak, `/api/empty-claude-rate` says Claude returned empty on ~48% of recent cycles — each is half the picture and none of them answers the operator's actual pre-print question: given those three facts *together*, is the bot statistically going to land a usable decision in time? Distinct from each ingredient (invariant #10 — do not "consolidate"): `earnings-risk` is the calendar slice, `decision-drought` is the historical PARALYSIS ledger, `empty-claude-rate` is the rolling-rate diagnostic — none compose them into a per-held-event verdict. `analytics/event_readiness.py::build_event_readiness` is pure; the endpoint is the I/O seam (pulls earnings events from `:8080/api/earnings` exactly as `/api/earnings-risk` does, decisions from the live store). For each held ticker with earnings in next 72h, computes `expected_decisions_before_event = cycles_per_hour × hours_until_event × (1 − empty_rate)` over the last 6h, classifies `READY` / `DEGRADED` (≥5 but <30 expected) / `BLIND` (<5) / `IMMINENT_OVERDUE` (event already passed — flags a stale calendar). The expected-decisions math is a *historical* average; a `_apply_streak_downgrade` rule then penalizes an **active** NO_DECISION streak (≥10 → READY→DEGRADED, ≥20 → any→BLIND) — that's the live PARALYSIS regime `/api/decision-drought` catches, and a 6h average can honestly read OK while the most-recent 30 cycles are all empty. Per-event `recommended_action` is operator-actionable (`"ACTIVE PARALYSIS streak: 25 NO_DECISION cycles ({M}m since last real decision) — restart paper-trader before the print, or pre-trim exposure"`) — the chat enrichment carries this verbatim, never re-derives. Portfolio-level `worst_verdict` + `exposure_at_risk_usd` (sum of BLIND+DEGRADED rows only) + a builder-own `summary` (the SSOT chat headline).

Sample-size honesty mirrors `news_edge`: numeric metrics emit from the first closed round-trip but the **verdict label is withheld until `STABLE` (n≥20 round-trips)** — `NO_DATA`→`EMERGING`→`STABLE`; a five-trade verdict is noise.

This partitions the decision log at the **newest legacy-tagged failure timestamp** (boundary; `None` ⇒ no legacy ⇒ all rows current) and reports the *post-restart* failure rate + a current-only mode mix, reusing `decision_forensics.classify_failure` (taxonomy) and `build_decision_drought` (`involuntary_alpha_bleed_pct`) as the single source of truth — nothing re-derived (`capital_paralysis` precedent). Sample-size honesty mirrors `news_edge`/`trade_asymmetry`: `NO_DATA` → `STALE_LEGACY_DOMINATED` (legacy failures > current_total **and** current_total < `MIN_CURRENT`=12 → `restart_recommended=True`; the actionable state — restart so failures get diagnostic tags & the sample grows) → `INSUFFICIENT` (current_total < `MIN_CURRENT`, verdict withheld) → `HEALTHY`/`DEGRADED`/`CRITICAL` judged on the **current** rate (≥25 DEGRADED, ≥50 CRITICAL — thresholds identical to `decision_forensics` so they never disagree). `headline_failure_rate_pct` passes `build_decision_forensics` through verbatim for the contrast; `dead_cycles_per_day` = current_rate × decisions/day (cadence from the full timestamp span; `None` on a zero/1-point span — never divides by zero); unparseable-`timestamp` rows are counted in totals but excluded from the current partition when a boundary exists.

Payload adds `n_partial`; the headline becomes `CASH-LIGHT — $X cash: …` instead of the old false `FREE — … fundable from cash now` whenever any idea is `PARTIAL`; the UI gains an amber `PARTIAL` chip + a `partial (cash + sale)` stat.

| `GET /api/source-edge` | **Which of digital-intern's ~17 collectors is worth trusting?** — the operator question nothing else asks. `/api/news-edge` grades the *score* (does an 8.0 headline beat a 3.0?); `/api/signal-followthrough` grades whether the bot *acted*. Neither grades the **source**: of the collectors feeding the pipeline (`rss`, `gdelt`, `reddit`, `scraped`, `google_news`, `finnhub`, `sec_edgar`, …), whose scored headlines actually precede abnormal moves and which are noise to cut/down-weight? Bins every scored live article by **collector family** and reports the 1/3/5-trading-day forward return — raw **and SPY-abnormal** — **pooled across score bands** per family. Pooling (not per-band) is deliberate: digital-intern's live news is only days-deep (`articles.db` shallow-history), so a per-source × per-band × per-horizon split is starved on day 1; the pooled per-source view is both the actionable one (cut a collector) and the one that reaches a usable sample first. **The dirty `source` column is normalised once by `_source_family` — a load-bearing design choice (documented in the module):** substring before the first `/`, trailing `_YYYY-MM[-DD]` stripped, lower-cased — so the live `GDELT/finance.yahoo.com` and the schema-doc'd rolling `gdelt_2025-09` pool into one collector while distinct collectors stay distinct; without it the leaderboard fragments into dozens of n<3 NOISE buckets. Two honesty controls identical to `news_edge`: SPY-abnormal (verdict judged on abnormal only) and a per-source sample gate (`_MIN_SOURCE_N`=8 — mirrors `news_edge._MIN_BAND_N`); below it a source is reported but not graded and the overall verdict is the honest `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, never a fabricated edge. Adaptive reference horizon + verdict *mature with history* exactly like `news_edge` (`NO_DATA` → `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` → `EDGE_FOUND`/`NO_EDGE`); per-source `verdict` ∈ `EXPLOITABLE`/`WEAK`/`NEGATIVE`/`INSUFFICIENT`; `headline` is the **single source of truth** the UI & chat both render so they can't drift. Ticker resolution / day-parse / at-or-after bar lookup are **imported from `news_edge`** (single source of truth, invariant #10 spirit) so the two panels can never disagree on which article belongs to which name; `_fetch_source_articles` inlines the canonical live-only clause verbatim (invariant #1) and is unit-tested against planted `backtest://`/`backtest_*`/`opus_annotation*` rows. `?days=` (lookback, default 30) / `?min_score=` (default 2.0).

| `GET /api/tail-risk` | **The left-tail view the upside-heavy surface was missing — "what is a realistic bad day?"** Every existing risk panel measures a *single worst path* (`/api/drawdown` max-DD) or *risk-adjusted upside* (`/api/analytics` Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar). None state the *frequency or shape* of daily losses. Returns historical 95/99% 1-day VaR (nearest-rank, sign kept honest — a positive quantile yields a negative "no loss" VaR, never a clamped 0), positional expected-shortfall CVaR (mean of the worst `ceil(q·n)` returns — **deliberately positional not value-threshold**: 99/110−1 and 89.1/99−1 are both "−0.10" but differ in the last float bit, so a `r<=threshold` filter silently drops one tie and halves the tail), population annualised vol & downside deviation (`/n` to match `analytics_api`'s Sharpe/Sortino exactly), Fisher-Pearson population skew (`None` when σ=0, never a fabricated 0), worst/best day, max consecutive down-day streak, Ulcer index. Daily series resampled **byte-identically** to `analytics_api`'s `by_day` last-write-wins loop (single-source-of-truth #10 spirit — a future refactor must change both or the dashboard's Sharpe and this panel silently disagree). Sample-size honesty mirrors `build_correlation`: `NO_DATA` (no equity) → `INSUFFICIENT` (<`MIN_RETURNS`=20 daily returns — numerics emitted, verdict withheld) → `OK`. Advisory only — never gates Opus, **never injected into the decision prompt** (invariants #2/#12; the tuned prompt + "no hard risk limits" identity). Also folded into `/api/analytics` as an additive top-level `tail_risk` key (keyed-assertion-safe) so the digital-intern analyst chat surfaces VaR/CVaR/skew with no extra fetch. Pure core: `analytics/tail_risk.py::build_tail_risk` (never raises). Locked by `tests/test_tail_risk.py` (hand-pinned discrete metrics, independent-impl cross-check for vol/skew, flat-book = the live 2026-05-14 shape, skew-sign, float-tie CVaR) + `tests/test_core_analytics.py::TestTailRiskIntegration` (endpoint↔builder no-drift). **No UI card** (invariant #14 `TestTemplateIdsUnique` footgun; endpoint + `/api/analytics` consumers only).

| `GET /api/correlation` | **Concentration honesty — do the held names actually move *together*?** `/api/risk` reports **name-level** concentration (`concentration_top1_pct`/`top3_pct`) and a single 3% SPY-shock; it cannot see **factor** concentration — a "2-position 59/41" book reads as merely concentrated, but if both names co-move the operator is running a *single bet* and the SPY-shock understates the tail. Computes pairwise Pearson **return** correlation among the held **stock** positions (deterministic ticker-sorted pairs; a flat series → `None`, never a fabricated 0), the most-coupled pair, the weight-Herfindahl `effective_positions_naive` (1/HHI), and the **correlation-adjusted `effective_independent_bets`** = `n / (1 + (n−1)·mean_ρ)` clamped to [1, n] — which collapses toward 1 as the names co-move however many tickers are on the book (mean ρ=−1 with n=2 → denominator 0 → honest `None`, never a fabricated number). Options are flagged & skipped (correlating a Greeks payoff against a linear return is meaningless — the `open_attribution`/`/api/backtests/compare` "stocks only" carve-out, #10 spirit). **The builder is pure; the yfinance daily-bar fetch lives in the endpoint** via the shared `_daily_history_cached` (3mo, the existing 30-min `_NEWS_EDGE_PX_CACHE`) — exactly the `thesis_drift` "network in the endpoint, builder takes the dicts" split, so the core is offline & deterministically testable and a fetch failure degrades to `INSUFFICIENT`, never an error. Sample-size honesty mirrors `news_edge`/`trade_asymmetry`: `NO_DATA` (no stock positions) → `INSUFFICIENT` (<2 correlatable names, or series < `MIN_RETURNS`=10 aligned daily returns — numerics where computable, verdict withheld) → `OK` with verdict precedence `SINGLE_NAME_RISK` (top weight ≥ `DOMINANT_WEIGHT`=60% — single-name risk reads first, correlation is secondary) > `CONCENTRATED` (mean ρ ≥ `HIGH_CORR`=0.70 — the book moves as one) > `MODERATE` (≥ `MOD_CORR`=0.40) > `DIVERSIFIED`.

| `GET /api/correlation-cluster-warning` | **Hidden-factor-bet alarm — translates `/api/correlation`'s pairwise matrix into a single cluster-share verdict.** The parent reports *mean* ρ across all pairs + one global verdict (`DIVERSIFIED`/`MODERATE`/`CONCENTRATED`/`SINGLE_NAME_RISK`). A book like {NVDA, AMD, AVGO, KO, JNJ} reads as `MODERATE` on mean ρ — but the first three names form a single semis cluster running as one trade inside a wrapper of two uncorrelated consumer staples. This endpoint surfaces that cluster: single-linkages the names at ρ ≥ `HIGH_CORR` (the same constant `/api/correlation` already uses for `CONCENTRATED`, imported verbatim so the two endpoints can never disagree on the threshold), returns the largest multi-name cluster + its share of book by market value + its internal mean ρ, and emits an `NO_CLUSTERS / WATCHLIST_CLUSTER / DOMINANT_CLUSTER / HIDDEN_FACTOR_BET` verdict keyed off the cluster's *weight* (not the mean ρ — so it catches the "5 names, 3 are one bet" regime the mean-ρ verdict misses). Weight bands: `WATCHLIST_CLUSTER` < 30% < `DOMINANT_CLUSTER` < 60% < `HIDDEN_FACTOR_BET` — chosen to mirror the spirit of the parent's `DIVERSIFIED_MAX_TOP_WEIGHT`/`DOMINANT_WEIGHT` for *single* names, generalised to co-moving clusters. Pure builder over the existing `build_correlation` payload (no new yfinance — the endpoint pays for one shared fetch, hands the payload to `build_correlation_cluster_warning`); upstream `NO_DATA`/`INSUFFICIENT` propagate verbatim so degraded states are honest. Single-linkage via iterative union-find (deterministic, stable across runs); singleton components are excluded (single-name risk is the parent's job).

Answers a question NO other panel does: **for each held name, when was the last live article that actually scored above noise (`MIN_SCORE_THRESHOLD`=4.0)?** Catches *thesis decay through silence* — a position opened on a catalyst whose news flow has dried up while the operator's attention moved on. There is no error message, no NO_DECISION storm, no Discord ping — only an absence. Per-position verdict ladder mirrors `position_attention`'s shape so the operator's eye reads them the same way: `FRESH` ≤6h (one trading session) → `WARM` ≤24h ("yesterday's news still counts") → `COOL` ≤72h ("story is aging fast") → `DARK` (catalyst window effectively closed; also the bucket for "no entry in news map at all" — silent / never seen).

When the trader spends cycle after cycle on `NO_DECISION (timeout/empty)` / flat `HOLD` (the dominant 2026-05-17 live pattern — `$972.69`, `$18.49` cash, MU stale-marked) an operator has no way to see *what Opus was fed*. This reconstructs it on demand: the prompt rendered through the **same `strategy._build_payload`** the live `decide()` uses (+ the identical `SYSTEM_PROMPT`/`ML ADVISOR` framing) so it is **byte-identical to the live prompt given identical inputs** (single source of truth, invariant #10 — no re-implemented prompt), bounded to `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS`=40000 with `prompt_chars`/`prompt_truncated` honesty keys; an `input_summary` (top/urgent/merged counts — `signal_count` is the *exact* value `decide()` writes to `decisions.signal_count` — watchlist/futures resolved-vs-missing, quant tickers, sentiment mentions); `advisory_blocks` presence (self-review/track-record/risk-mirror/ml); the embedded `/api/mark-integrity`; and a `feed_state` ∈ `BLIND` (0 merged signals — a HOLD this cycle is *forced* by an empty feed, not chosen) / `DEGRADED` (≥`DEGRADED_MISSING_RATIO`=50% of watchlist prices missing — the yfinance starvation behind the timeout storms) / `OK`. **`_claude_call` is never invoked** (`claude_invoked:false`; locked by an endpoint test that monkeypatches it to raise and still expects 200). The snapshot is the new write-free `strategy.portfolio_snapshot_readonly`, which shares the extracted pure `strategy._mark_to_market` with the live `_portfolio_snapshot` so the inspector's marks (incl. expired-option intrinsic #13 + `stale_mark`) can never drift from the real ones (invariant #10) and the dashboard thread never mutates the live trader's persisted marks/equity.

That flag is surfaced *per position* to Opus & Discord, but nothing answers the **aggregate**: what share of gross book value is marked at cost, so `/api/analytics` Sharpe, `/api/drawdown`, the equity curve and the headline P&L are all quietly partially false. Reports `n_stale`, `stale_value_usd`, `stale_value_pct` of gross, per-name rows, `stale_tickers`, and a verdict `NO_DATA`→`CLEAN`→`DEGRADED` (0<pct<`UNTRUSTWORTHY_PCT`=50, or gross 0 with stale rows so the share is unquantifiable) →`UNTRUSTWORTHY` (≥50% — treat every displayed P/L as substantially fictional until the feed recovers / runner restarts).

### Common failure modes (live trader)

| Symptom | Likely cause | Where to look |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Loop posts `NO_DECISION` every cycle | Claude returned malformed JSON or timed out (`DECISION_TIMEOUT_S=120`) | `strategy.py::_parse_decision`; tail runner stdout for `[strategy] claude err:` |
| Live trader stuck on `BLOCKED` for a SELL | `_enforce_risk_pre_trade` rejected — qty > held, or option `strike+expiry` unspecified with multiple open legs | `strategy.py::_enforce_risk_pre_trade`, `_execute` (option ambiguity check) |
| Hourly summary never posts | `_maybe_hourly` only advances on send success; openclaw missing → permanent retry-loop with stdout log | Search runner stdout for `[reporter] openclaw not installed` |
| `signals.get_top_signals` returns `[]` | `articles.db` not at `USB_DB` (USB unmounted) or `LOCAL_DB`; live-only filter is correct so backtest contamination is *not* the cause | `signals._db_path()`; run `python3 -m paper_trader.signals` |
| `paper_trader.db is locked` | Another writer attached without `?mode=ro`; or a long-running query inside `_lock` | Check for ad-hoc scripts; only the runner should write |
| Dashboard `/api/scorer-predictions` shows `is_trained: false` | `data/decision_outcomes.jsonl` has < 500 rows — scorer hasn't trained enough yet | `wc -l data/decision_outcomes.jsonl` |
| Discord posts stop entirely (`[reporter] openclaw not installed; would send:` spam, every report dropped) | **`openclaw` is an npm-global under the nvm node bin; the systemd unit launches `runner.py` with a minimal PATH that excludes it, so `shutil.which('openclaw')` returned `None`** (live-finding 2026-05-17 — `openclaw` *was* installed at `~/.nvm/versions/node/<v>/bin/openclaw`, just unreachable). **Root-fixed (review pass #10):** `reporter._resolve_openclaw()` now tries `OPENCLAW_BIN` env override → `PATH` → well-known fallbacks (`~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `~/.nvm/.../bin`). Applies on next runner restart. If it *still* fails: auth expired, or set `OPENCLAW_BIN=/abs/path/openclaw` in the unit | `which openclaw` (may be on *your* PATH but not the unit's — compare `tr '\0' '\n' </proc/<runner-pid>/environ \| grep ^PATH`); `python3 -c "from paper_trader.reporter import _resolve_openclaw; print(_resolve_openclaw())"` |
| Trader frozen — `NO_DECISION` every cycle for hours, equity flat, **no Discord alert** | **Claude CLI quota/usage-limit exhausted** — `claude` exits rc=1 with stdout `You've hit your org's monthly usage limit` (Opus *and* the Sonnet fallback). The circuit-breaker pkill is futile (the process already exited). **Surfaced (review pass #10):** `strategy._is_quota_exhausted` flags it → `summary["quota_exhausted"]` → `runner._cycle` fires ONE `reporter.send_quota_alert` (deduped; re-armed + a `RECOVERED` notice when a real decision lands) and skips the futile breaker. The alert only reaches Discord once the openclaw-resolution fix above is also live | `grep -a 'QUOTA EXHAUSTED' logs/runner.log`; `/api/decision-reliability` (`TIMEOUT_EMPTY` 100% of current failures with a fresh feed = quota, not a feed outage); resolve the Anthropic quota / upgrade the plan — a runner restart will NOT help |
| Live cross-dashboard (`:8080` → `:8090`) shows blanks | CORS or paper-trader process down | `curl http://localhost:8090/api/portfolio` |
| Strategy returns `HOLD` constantly even with strong signals | Opus is being conservative — by design, no threshold gating to override | Inspect the prompt context in `strategy.py::_build_payload`; if the watchlist has stale prices yfinance is rate-limited |
| Equity / P/L looks too high and won't come down; an option position never closes | Pre-fix `_portfolio_snapshot` marked an expired contract at avg_cost forever (no live chain past expiry). Fixed — see invariant #13. If you see this on an old `:8090` process, check `/api/build-info` `stale` and restart | `strategy._option_expired` / `_expired_intrinsic`; `SELECT * FROM positions WHERE type IN ('call','put') AND closed_at IS NULL AND expiry < date('now')` |
| `logs/runner.log` has no `[runner]`/`[strategy]` lines, only `"GET /api/… HTTP/1.1"` | **`logs/runner.log` captures only the Werkzeug HTTP access log, NOT the runner's own stdout** (live-finding 2026-05-17). Every "tail runner stdout / runner.log for `[strategy] claude err`" instruction above & in `CLAUDE.md` §11 is *blind* against that file — the NO_DECISION/timeout/circuit-breaker `print()`s go to the runner's real stdout (a terminal / launcher), not here. This is a launcher/logging-infra gap, not a code bug (deliberately not "fixed" in a surgical core pass — changing logging perturbs the live process) | Find the runner's true stdout: `tr '\0' ' ' </proc/$(pgrep -f 'paper_trader.runner\|paper-trader/runner.py' | head -1)/cmdline`; check the launcher's redirection / `journalctl`. Decision-level history is reliable via `/api/decision-forensics` + `recent_decisions` (DB), which *do* capture the failure taxonomy |
| Decisions ~hourly (not every `OPEN_INTERVAL_S`=1800s) while open; new endpoints 404; self-review maybe not injected | The running `:8090`/runner is **stale** — booted ≥1 commit ago (`/api/build-info` `stale:true`, `behind:N`). It runs pre-fix resolvers/cadence and 404s endpoints added since boot (live-finding 2026-05-17: `behind:33`, `/api/runner-heartbeat` 404). A long NO_DECISION run also inflates effective cadence (Opus 180s + Sonnet 60s + retry 45s per failed cycle). The on-disk fixes do **not** apply until restart | `curl -s localhost:8090/api/build-info`; restart `paper_trader.runner` to apply HEAD (also applies the invariant #6/#18 fixes). NO_DECISION cause → `/api/decision-forensics` |

| 2–3 decisions clustered inside a minute, then ~1h of nothing; equity/decision log looks raced; doubled `claude` RAM | **Two `runner.py` processes on the same paper book** — e.g. an orphaned manual launch (parent PID 1) *and* the systemd unit, each on its own cadence (live-finding 2026-05-17: PID 1255030 orphan + PID 1317545 systemd). The single-instance guard (invariant #19) prevents *recurrence* but only **on the next restart of each** — it does not kill an already-running duplicate | `ps -eo pid,ppid,etime,cmd | grep '[r]unner.py'` — if >1, stop the orphan (keep the systemd one); after each restarts, `cat data/paper_trader.runner.lock` shows the single live holder PID. A second start now self-exits with `[runner] another paper trader is already running (pid=…)` |
| Live trader makes decisions with `signal_count=0` for many cycles though `articles.db` is fresh | Upstream: digital-intern's scorer degraded — articles are *collected* (fresh `first_seen`) but `ai_score` stays `0.0`/`urgency 0`, so `get_top_signals(min_score=4.0)` + `get_urgent_articles` both return `[]`. **Not a paper-trader core bug** — `/api/feed-health` correctly reports `BLIND` with `resolved_live_2h>0`; the headline spells out the paradox. A paper-trader restart will NOT help (the fix is in digital-intern's scoring daemon) | `/api/feed-health` (`verdict:BLIND`, `resolved_live_2h`); `SELECT MAX(ai_score) FROM articles WHERE first_seen>=<2h-ago> AND <live-only>` → if `0.0`, the digital-intern scorer is down |

## ML / backtest domain

### How the DecisionScorer works

`paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py` defines an MLP (`sklearn.MLPRegressor`,
with a numpy lstsq fallback) that predicts **5-trading-day forward return %**
from a 17-dim feature vector:

| Slot | Feature | Source | Default |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| 0 | `ml_score` | parsed from `_ml_decide` reasoning | 0.0 |
| 1 | `rsi` (14-period) | `_compute_technical_indicators` | 50.0 |
| 2 | `macd_signal` (numeric) | same | 0.0 |
| 3 | `mom5` (5-day %) | same | 0.0 |
| 4 | `mom20` (20-day %) | same | 0.0 |
| 5 | `regime_mult` | `_market_regime` (bull=1.0, sideways=0.6, bear=0.3, unknown=1.0) | 1.0 |
| 6 | `vol_ratio` | clamped to [0, 5] | 1.0 |
| 7 | `bb_pos` | clamped to [-2, 2] | 0.0 |
| 8 | `news_urgency` | clamped to [0, 100] | 50.0 |
| 9 | `news_article_count` | clamped to [0, 20] | 1.0 |
| 10..16 | sector one-hot | `SECTOR_MAP` lookup | "other" |

Training happens in `run_continuous_backtests.py::_train_decision_scorer`
after each cycle. Until trained AND `_n_train >= 500`, `predict()` returns
`0.0` and `_ml_decide` ignores it entirely.

Once `_scorer.is_trained and _n_train >= 500`, the scorer **modulates BUY
conviction only — it never cancels a trade** (an earlier HOLD-block
version oscillated leveraged-ETF strategies; see the comment in
`_ml_decide`). Given the predicted 5-day return `p`:

| Condition | Effect on conviction |

**Prediction is clamped to the empirical label support.** `MLPRegressor`
has no output bound, so for off-distribution feature vectors it extrapolates
to nonsense (observed: −89% then +32% for the *same* LITE vector across two
retrain cycles — the unbounded head is volatile). `predict()` clamps its
output to `±PRED_CLAMP_PCT` (50%). The bound is load-bearing-safe: across the
9k+ rows in `decision_outcomes.jsonl` only ~0.4% of real 5d outcomes exceed
|50%| (p1=−25%, p99=+32%), and every gate boundary above (±10/±5/0) sits well
inside ±50, so a clamped −89→−50 stays in the same `p < -10 → ×0.6` bucket —
**gating behaviour is unchanged**. Clamping is output-only: it does not touch
`build_features`/`SECTORS`/`N_FEATURES`, so the pickle stays compatible, and
`train_scorer` never calls `predict()`, so there is no label-feedback loop.
The untrained short-circuit (`return 0.0`) still runs *before* the clamp.
`predict_with_meta()` is the sibling that exposes
`{pred, raw, clamped, off_distribution}` for panels that want to flag
extrapolation honestly (`/api/scorer-predictions` adds `off_distribution`
+ `raw_pred_5d_return_pct`; the unified dashboard's `_conviction_axes` decays
the ML axis toward a 0.3 trust floor once `|pred| > 20%` instead of letting a
clamped floor read as full ±1.0 conviction). Locked by
`tests/test_decision_scorer.py::TestPredictionClamp`.

**Honesty on a *failed* prediction (2026-05-17 fix).** When
`model.predict()` itself *raises* — the exact scenario the handler's
"silenced after first" log guards (a `build_features` feature added
without retraining the pickle ⇒ shape/dtype mismatch) —
`predict_with_meta()` now returns `clamped: True, off_distribution:
True` (was `False`/`False`). A scorer that *cannot score the input at
all* must not look identical to one confidently predicting a flat 0.0:
the honesty panels above read `off_distribution`, so the old value
rendered a broken scorer as gospel. This mirrors the non-finite branch
precedent and keeps the documented `off_distribution`-is-an-alias-of-
`clamped` invariant. `predict()`'s scalar contract is unchanged (still
the safe `0.0`) — only the meta trust flags move. Locked by
`tests/test_decision_scorer.py::TestPredictionClamp::test_predict_exception_is_flagged_low_trust`.

**Concurrency invariant (`backtest.py`):** the module-global
`_VOLUME_CACHE` is shared across the parallel run threads. Every read
*and* every iteration of it must hold `_VOLUME_CACHE_LOCK` — iterating it
unlocked while another run thread inserts raises
`RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration`, which the
persist helper's `try/except` swallows (silently dropping the disk
cache so every run re-fetches volumes from yfinance). It is also
window-keyed and never evicted, so a long-lived continuous loop's RSS
grows slowly across cycles — restart the loop periodically; do not add
an ad-hoc eviction policy without measuring.

### How to run backtests manually

```bash
cd /home/zeph/paper-trader

# One-shot — 10 parallel year-long runs, default window 2025-05-01..2026-05-13
python3 run_backtests.py

# Continuous loop — 5 runs per cycle, retrains scorer between cycles
python3 run_continuous_backtests.py

# View results
sqlite3 backtest.db "SELECT run_id, total_return_pct, vs_spy_pct, status FROM backtest_runs ORDER BY run_id DESC LIMIT 20"

# Live dashboard
# http://localhost:8090/backtests
```

### How to interpret backtest results

- `total_return_pct` — full-window % change vs. $1000 starting capital.
  Positive means the persona made money; the "winner" of a cycle is the
  highest-positive run.
- `vs_spy_pct` — alpha vs. SPY buy-and-hold over the same window. The
  meaningful metric for skill evaluation.
- `status` — `running` / `complete` / `failed`. `failed` rows often mean
  yfinance returned nothing for the persona's preferred tickers; check
  `continuous.log` for the matching `[engine] RUN N CRASHED:` line.
- `equity_curve_json` — JSON list of `{date, value, cash}` snapshots; the
  dashboard renders these. Sparse during a run (every 5 samples) and full
  at finalize.

A healthy cycle log looks like:

```
[engine] SPY baseline 2025-05-01 → 2026-05-13: +X.X%
[engine] Launching 5 runs starting at run_id=N
[run K] DONE  final=$..  return=+Y.Y%  vs SPY +Z.Z%  trades=NN
[continuous] computed N decision outcomes from M runs
[continuous] scorer ok n=N rmse=...
[continuous] ml: injected I new | trainer n=N loss=...
```

If `scorer insufficient_after_dedup n=...` keeps appearing, the
`data/decision_outcomes.jsonl` tail is too small or too duplicated — more
cycles need to accumulate before the scorer can train.

> persona routinely posts `+1000%+ / vs_spy +1200%` over a 6–10yr window
> heavy in 3× ETFs (SOXL/TQQQ), while a *different* persona on the **same

> dispersion through a cherry-able bull window, **not** repeatable alpha.

> validation suite (`data/validation_results.json`) is the real
> skill-vs-luck arbiter; the per-run number is not.

### Scorer calibration diagnostic

`paper_trader/ml/calibration.py` is a **read-only** quant diagnostic
(no train, no pickle/`build_features`/`N_FEATURES` touch, no trade path —
safe to run against the live unattended loop). It answers *"does a high
predicted 5d return actually precede a high realized one?"* by separating
the two failure modes a single RMSE hides:

- **rank skill** — tie-aware Spearman over every `(pred, realized)` pair.
  Tie-awareness is load-bearing: the scorer clamps to ±`PRED_CLAMP_PCT`,
  so off-distribution predictions tie at exactly ±50 — plain
  `argsort(argsort)` fabricates rank skill there (a constant predictor
  would score 1.0).
- **magnitude bias** — per-decile `mean_pred` vs `mean_realized`.

```bash
# Calibration of the live pickle vs the accumulated outcomes tail
cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.calibration
```

Verdicts: `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` (< `MIN_PAIRS`), `MISCALIBRATED`
(spearman < `SPEARMAN_MIN` or decile curve not mostly monotone),
`DIRECTIONAL_BUT_BIASED` (rank-skilled but mean decile error >
`BIAS_TOL_PCT` — trust the *sign/ordering*, discount the predicted %),
`WELL_CALIBRATED`, `WEAK_SIGNAL`. `scorer_calibration()` flips the SELL
target sign (`-forward_return_5d`) exactly like `train_scorer`, so a
rank-skilled SELL model is not a false `MISCALIBRATED`. Thresholds are
module constants; verdicts are exact-value test-locked in
`tests/test_calibration.py`.

### Bootstrap CIs on OOS skill — `paper_trader/ml/skill_uncertainty.py`

Every existing OOS diagnostic (`_oos_rank_metrics`, `evaluate_scorer_oos`,
`calibration --oos`, `skill_trend`) reports the metric as a **single point
estimate** per cycle. With OOS sample sizes in the hundreds-to-low-thousands
and near-zero underlying skill, a single number can't tell a skeptical quant
whether a rank-IC of 0.04 is real-but-weak signal or noise around 0.

`skill_uncertainty.py` runs a percentile bootstrap (Efron) on the deployed
scorer's OOS pairs and reports **95% confidence intervals** on rank-IC /
RMSE / dir-acc, with a crisp verdict:

| Verdict | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `NOT_TRAINED` | `scorer.is_trained` is False |
| `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` | < `MIN_OOS=30` finite OOS pairs |
| `SKILL_DETECTED` | rank-IC CI strictly excludes 0 (statistically distinguishable) |
| `NO_SKILL_DETECTED` | rank-IC CI straddles or sits below 0 |

Same operational discipline as `calibration.py` / `gate_audit.py` /
`skill_trend.py`: read-only, no train, no pickle / `build_features` /
`N_FEATURES` touch, never raises (`bootstrap_skill_ci` degrades to
`status='error'` on any fault). Single source of truth — the OOS split is
`validation.split_outcomes_temporal` (the EXACT split
`_train_decision_scorer` uses for `oos_rmse`), the predict signature is
the same 11-kwarg path `_oos_rank_metrics` uses, the rank correlation is
`calibration._spearman`, and the universal SELL sign-flip is applied. So
this module and the ledger's scalar metrics can never drift.

```bash
# Default: 1000 resamples, 95% CI, deterministic seed
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.skill_uncertainty

# Tighter CI with more resamples; JSON for downstream tooling
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.skill_uncertainty --bootstraps 2000 --json
```

Exit code 0 only when the verdict is `SKILL_DETECTED` — so a shell caller
can `if !; then` gate dashboards on real distinguishable skill, not noisy
point estimates. Locked by `tests/test_skill_uncertainty.py` (13 tests):
strong signal → SKILL_DETECTED with CI excluding 0; pure noise →
NO_SKILL_DETECTED with CI straddling 0; anti-correlated → CI fully below
0; insufficient n; untrained; SELL sign-flip; NaN-row dropping; seed
reproducibility (same seed ⇒ identical CIs, different seeds ⇒ different
CI bounds); crash-resilience.

### Position sizing invariant (`_ml_decide`)

A backtest BUY's notional is `min(total_val * conviction, cash * 0.95)`.
`conviction` has a hard ceiling: `min(0.25, best_score/20)` for normal
tickers, `min(0.40, best_score/15)` for a `_LEVERAGED_ETFS` name in a
bull/sideways regime. The DecisionScorer (once `_n_train >= 500`) only
*modulates* this conviction — it never lifts the cap (the ×1.3/×1.15
tailwind arms are themselves capped at 0.95, and the notional is still
clipped by the two `min`s). Both arms are now test-locked:
`tests/test_backtest.py::TestMlDecide::test_oversize_buy_clipped_by_cash`
pins the cash arm; `::test_conviction_caps_position_size_when_cash_is_abundant`
pins the conviction arm with exact expected values (a regression that drops
`min(0.25, …)` doubles the notional and fails the assertion). If you change
the conviction formula, update both tests deliberately — they assert exact
numbers, not ranges, by design.

The five **scorer-gate arms** themselves are now exact-value locked in
`tests/test_ml_backtest_review.py::TestMlDecideScorerGate`: with the module
`_DECISION_SCORER` singleton swapped for a fake returning a fixed prediction,
each arm's effect on a base conviction of 0.25 is asserted as an exact share
qty (`p<-10 → 75.0`, `-10≤p<0 → 106.25`, `0≤p≤5 → 125.0`, `5<p≤10 → 143.75`,
`p>10 → 162.5`), plus the **n_train ≥ 500 gate** (a trained scorer with
`_n_train = 100` must NOT modulate, even on a -50 prediction — locks invariant
#5). Any change to the gate thresholds or multipliers must update these
assertions deliberately.

**Off-distribution gate abstention (2026-05-17).** `_ml_decide` now calls
`_scorer.predict_with_meta()` (falling back to the plain `predict()` scalar
for the `_Dummy` stub / predict-only test fakes, treated as in-distribution).
When the scorer flags `off_distribution=True` — the unbounded MLP head
extrapolated beyond `±PRED_CLAMP_PCT`, or `predict` raised / went non-finite
— the five conviction arms are **skipped entirely**: the quant-derived
conviction is left untouched rather than modulated on a clamped ±50 that
carries no information (AGENTS.md already documents the head emitting −89→+32
for the *same* LITE vector across retrains). In-distribution behaviour is
byte-identical to before (`predict()` delegates to
`predict_with_meta()["pred"]`), so every exact-value `TestMlDecideScorerGate`
assertion is unchanged. The abstention is surfaced in the decision
`reasoning` as `scorer=…%(off-dist,gate-skipped)`. Locked by
`tests/test_ml_backtest_review.py::TestMlDecideOffDistributionGate`
(catastrophic −50 off-dist → conviction unchanged; in-dist meta path still
modulates identically; reasoning surfaces the skip; independent of the
`n_train<500` guard).

### Continuous-loop durability & honesty (2026-05-17)

- **Scorer-skill ledger now wired in.** `_append_scorer_skill_log` /
  `_parse_scorer_status` existed but were **never called** — the durable
  per-cycle OOS-skill audit trail was dead code; the metrics only reached
  the ephemeral, rotated `continuous.log`. `main()` now appends exactly one
  structured row per cycle to `data/scorer_skill_log.jsonl`
  (`{cycle, timestamp, window_*, status, train_n, val_rmse, oos_n, oos_rmse,
  oos_dir_acc, oos_ic, gate_active}`). On a non-training cycle (no outcome
  records) it writes the `no outcome records` sentinel with a
  `_deployed_scorer_n_train()` hint so `gate_active` (⇔ deployed
  `n_train ≥ 500`, invariant #5) stays truthful. Bounded at
  `SCORER_SKILL_LOG_KEEP=2000` via the atomic tmp+`.replace` idiom.
  **This is the canonical instrument for the negative-OOS-skill question
  below — query it, not grep'd log lines.** Locked by
  `tests/test_continuous.py::TestParseScorerStatus` /
  `TestAppendScorerSkillLog` / `TestDeployedScorerNTrain` /
  `TestCycleWiringRegression`.

- **`winner_training.jsonl` is now bounded.** It had grown to ~322 MB /
  860 k lines, unbounded, while every sibling JSONL is trimmed — a latent
  disk-full risk (the OSError [Errno 28] class noted in
  `decision_scorer.py`). `_trim_winner_jsonl()` (called once per cycle from
  `main()`) keeps the last `WINNER_JSONL_KEEP=50000` records via the same
  atomic tmp+`.replace` idiom; far above the 10 k `_inject_and_train` tail so
  the consumer is never starved (older rows are already idempotently in
  `articles.db`). Locked by `TestTrimWinnerJsonl`.

- **Per-cycle orphan reap.** `_reap_orphaned_runs()` was startup-only, so a
  run thread hard-killed mid-cycle (OOM/SIGKILL — never reaches
  `finalize_run` or `run_all`'s caught-`failed` marker) stayed
  `status='running'` forever for a long-lived loop (observed live: 15 rows
  stuck 35 h while ~170 newer runs completed — the "dashboard shows running
  forever" symptom, CLAUDE.md §11). `main()` now also reaps once per cycle;
  the reaper is idempotent, best-effort and 6 h-age-guarded so it can never
  touch a live run. Locked by
  `TestCycleWiringRegression::test_main_reaps_orphans_per_cycle_not_only_at_startup`.

- **`vs_spy_pct` benchmark-honesty flag.** yfinance intermittently fails to
  return SPY for a window; `PriceCache` then persists an **empty SPY series**
  (verified: `prices_2021-08-02_2025-08-01.json` had `SPY_rows={}` while 116
  other tickers loaded). `_build_trading_days` falls back to another ticker's
  calendar so the run still completes, but `returns_pct("SPY",…)` returns
  `0.0` → `vs_spy_pct == total_return` with **no real benchmark** (80/485
  complete runs / 16 windows live). The NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 schema
  (invariant #13) blocks a true NULL, so `run_one` now writes a
  `benchmark_unavailable: …` string into the additive nullable `notes`
  column + a stderr WARNING. **Purely informational — zero change to
  returns, winner selection, or the live `_ml_is_qualified` gate.** Locked by
  `tests/test_integration_backtest.py::TestBenchmarkUnavailableNote`.
  > **Still open (reported, not fixed — out of surgical scope):** the

  > run's alpha.

### Out-of-sample calibration view + training-integrity filter (2026-05-18)

- **Only FILLED trades feed scorer/ArticleNet training (fix).**
  `_compute_decision_outcomes` and `_append_top_decisions` read
  `backtest_decisions` for BUY/SELL rows but did **not** filter on execution
  status. `run_one` records a terminal non-FILLED decision row for the last
  intraday decision when nothing filled that day; had that decision been a
  BUY/SELL `_execute_decision` rejected, its 5d forward return would have
  trained the DecisionScorer (and `winner_training.jsonl`→ArticleNet) as a
  *phantom outcome for a position that never moved capital* — and the
  blocking reason (out of cash / no price) is regime-correlated, so it is
  biased contamination, not noise. Both pipeline queries now require
  `status = 'FILLED'`. **Latent, not active**: an audit of the live
  `backtest.db.local_backup` showed BUY/SELL decisions are *100% FILLED*
  (5393 FILLED, 0 non-FILLED; HOLD is the only other status) — `_ml_decide`
  only ever emits executable decisions today. The filter makes the
  "trained only on real fills" invariant explicit and refactor-proof (one
  position-cap commit away from silently corrupting the scorer). Locked by
  `tests/test_continuous.py::TestFilledOnlyTrainingIntegrity` (FILLED
  survives, BLOCKED excluded, on *both* pipelines).

- **OOS calibration view (`calibration.py --oos`, feature).**
  `scorer_calibration` over the full `decision_outcomes.jsonl` is an
  *in-sample* read (the scorer trained on most of those rows), so its
  `WELL_CALIBRATED` verdict is optimistic — AGENTS.md already warned of
  this but there was no out-of-sample *decile* view (`skill_trend.py`
  trends the ledger's scalar `oos_rmse`/`oos_ic`; `gate_audit.py` buckets
  by the 5 economic gate arms — neither shows the magnitude-bias decile
  curve + crisp verdict on unseen data). `scorer_calibration_oos()` reuses
  `paper_trader.validation.split_outcomes_temporal` — the **exact** split
  `_train_decision_scorer` uses for `oos_rmse`/`oos_ic`, so this decile
  view and the ledger's scalar OOS metrics describe the *same* holdout —
  and runs the same `scorer_calibration` report on only the most-recent
  `oos_fraction` (default 0.2) by `sim_date`. Returns the report plus
  `{oos_n, train_n, oos_fraction}`. `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.calibration
  --oos` prints the in-sample report (byte-identical default), then the
  temporal-holdout report, then an explicit optimism-gap line when
  in-sample is `WELL_CALIBRATED` but OOS is not. Read-only, never raises
  (degrades to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` — same operational discipline as the
  rest of the module). Exact-value locked by
  `tests/test_calibration.py::TestScorerCalibrationOOS` (split sizes &
  metadata, slice-equivalence to `scorer_calibration(recs[-oos:])`,
  history-`WELL_CALIBRATED` vs OOS-`MISCALIBRATED` overfit signature,
  `< 5`-row and empty degradation).

### Multi-horizon outcome capture + horizon audit (2026-05-18)

- **`_compute_decision_outcomes` now additively records
  `forward_return_10d` / `forward_return_20d`** alongside the unchanged
  `forward_return_5d`. The DecisionScorer still trains **only** on the 5d
  label (`train_scorer` reads `forward_return_5d` exclusively) and the gate
  is untouched — the extra horizons are pure read-only research signal. The
  helper `_fwd_ret_h(ticker, sim_d, idx, h)` (defined beside `_td_index`)
  is best-effort: a horizon whose window runs past cached price history
  yields `None` and **never** skips or zeroes the 5d row training depends
  on (the 5d path is byte-identical — locked by
  `tests/test_horizon_audit.py::TestComputeDecisionOutcomesMultiHorizon`,
  exact `8.3333 / 16.6667 / 33.3333` on the synthetic curve + the
  5d-present/10d-20d-`None` tail case). Legacy rows in
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` have no 10d/20d keys; they populate as the
  continuous loop runs the new code.

- **`paper_trader/ml/horizon_audit.py` (new read-only diagnostic).** Every
  pre-existing OOS arbiter (calibration / gate_audit / skill_trend /
  baseline_compare / regime_audit) can *only* measure skill against the 5d
  label — none can answer the decisive question that follows from their
  shared `oos_ic ≈ 0` finding: **is the scorer near-blind because the
  features carry no signal, or because the 5-trading-day target is just too
  noisy** (AGENTS.md already notes leveraged ETFs have "noisy 5d windows
  but strong 3-12 month returns"). On the temporal-OOS slice (the *same*
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` every other OOS tool uses) it
  rank-ICs the two signals that actually drive `_ml_decide` — `ml_score`
  (feature slot 0) and `mom20` — against each of 5d/10d/20d, reusing
  `calibration._spearman` and the codebase-universal SELL sign-flip

  `INSUFFICIENT_LONG_HORIZON` (5d sampled but 10d/20d not yet accumulated —

### Persona name + raw regime label in outcomes (2026-05-19)

- **`_compute_decision_outcomes` now additively records `persona` (e.g.
  `"Momentum Trader"`) + `regime_label` (raw `bull` / `sideways` / `bear` /
  `unknown` string)** on every outcome row. Inert to scorer training
  (`train_scorer` / `build_features` ignore unknown dict keys — the
  `forward_return_10d/20d` / `wk52_pos` / `gate_scorer_pred` precedent), so
  no retrain is required and the scorer pickle / `N_FEATURES` / every
  existing OOS diagnostic stay byte-identical.
- **Why persona:** `persona_skill` / `persona_leaderboard` already derive
  the persona via `persona_for(run_id)` at analysis time. Capturing the
  NAME directly lets ad-hoc shell queries
  (`grep '"persona": "Momentum"' data/decision_outcomes.jsonl | …`) and
  future per-persona diagnostics filter without re-importing the live
  `PERSONAS` dict. If a future change renames or adds personas, old
  outcome rows still self-describe (they carry the persona name as it was
  when the decision happened, not as it is now).
- **Why regime_label:** `regime_mult` (0.3 / 0.6 / 1.0) is a stringly-typed
  encoding of the `bull` / `sideways` / `bear` / `unknown` label that
  `_ml_decide` and `_compute_decision_outcomes` both compute from the SPY
  50/200 MA via `_market_regime`. The multiplier alone cannot distinguish
  `bull` from `unknown` (both = 1.0), so a regime-conditional cut on
  `regime_mult == 1.0` silently lumps SPY-pre-200d-history `unknown`
  cycles with real bull cycles — biasing every per-regime analysis.
  Capturing the raw label resolves that ambiguity. `regime_audit` (which
  decodes the same label from `regime_mult`) keeps working unchanged.
- **Test-locked in `tests/test_continuous.py::TestWk52PosCapturedInOutcomes`:**
  `test_persona_and_regime_label_captured` (run_id=2 → `"Momentum Trader"`,
  `regime_label` is one of the documented strings),
  `test_persona_field_present_for_run_id_1` (run_id=1 → `"Value Investor"`,
  locks the `persona_for` `((run_id - 1) % 10) + 1` cycling formula),
  `test_capture_does_not_break_existing_keys` (full schema regression —
  every previously-documented outcome field must still appear).

### Per-window volume cache atomic write (2026-05-19)

- **`_persist_volume_cache_for_window` now uses tmp+`.replace`** instead of
  a bare `path.write_text(json.dumps(flat))`. The bare write is NOT atomic:
  a process kill (OOM / SIGKILL, the documented `CLAUDE.md §11` continuous-
  loop failure mode) mid-write leaves a torn / truncated JSON file. The
  next `_load_volume_cache_for_window` then fails `json.loads`, falls back
  to an empty dict (silent `except` swallows the error), and *still* marks
  the window "loaded" in `_VOLUME_CACHE_DISK_LOADED` — so every subsequent
  `vol_ratio` computation re-fetches the volume series from yfinance for
  the entire window. Worse, a CONCURRENT loader in another thread can read
  a partially-written file (same swallow path, same yfinance re-fetch
  cascade). The fix writes `<path>.json.tmp` then atomically renames it
  over the canonical `<path>.json`, mirroring the tmp+`.replace` idiom
  `train_scorer` (scorer.pkl.tmp), the outcomes-file trim, and the
  validation persister already use — all of which document the same class
  of "a process kill mid-write would corrupt the artifact" failure.
- **Test-locked in
  `tests/test_backtest.py::TestVolumeCachePersistAtomicity`:**
  `test_persist_writes_canonical_path_atomically` (canonical file exists +
  no tmp shadow remains after a successful persist),
  `test_torn_tmp_does_not_corrupt_canonical_path` (a half-written `.tmp`
  from a simulated prior crash is silently overwritten by the next
  successful persist — canonical content is the new payload, no torn data
  leaks), `test_load_ignores_tmp_shadow_filename` (loader opens the
  canonical `.json` path directly and never reads a corrupt `.json.tmp`
  shadow even when both exist on disk).

### Per-ticker scorer skill diagnostic (2026-05-19)

- **`paper_trader/ml/per_ticker_skill.py` (new read-only diagnostic).**
  `sector_skill` answers "is the calibration uniform across the seven
  sectors?" but the next quant question is one level finer: *within a
  sector, which individual tickers does the scorer actually predict well,
  and which is it actively wrong on?* `build_features` carries a 7-way
  sector one-hot but **no per-ticker identity**, so two tickers in the
  same sector are forced to share sector weights even if their realized 5d
  behaviour diverges sharply (e.g. NVDA vs INTC, both `sector_tech`).
  Empirically the live `decision_outcomes.jsonl` tail is also ticker-
  concentrated (top 10 tickers carry ~70% of outcomes — SOXL / TQQQ /
  AMZN / MSTR / MSFT dominate), so the headline `oos_ic` from the scorer
  ledger is essentially a weighted average of a handful of leveraged-ETF
  names. The diagnostic buckets the temporal-OOS rows by ticker (same
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` the scorer ledger uses) and
  produces per-ticker `n_train` / `n_oos` / `mean_pred` vs `mean_realized`
  (magnitude bias) / `rmse` / `dir_acc` / tie-aware
  `rank_ic` (via the shared `calibration._spearman` — never drifts from
  `sector_skill` / `persona_skill` / `_oos_rank_metrics`) plus a per-
  ticker verdict (`SPARSE`/`INVERTED_SIGNAL`/`SIGNAL_EDGE`/
  `WEAK_SIGNAL_EDGE`/`NO_SIGNAL_EDGE`) and an overall verdict
  (`HAS_INVERTED_TICKER` — actionable red flag, the gate is *actively
  harmful* on that name / `NO_TICKER_EDGE` / `HEALTHY` /
  `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`). Output is sorted by `rank_ic` desc with `SPARSE`
  rows sunk to the bottom and capped at `MAX_TICKERS_IN_REPORT=50`; the
  separate `inverted_tickers` list is **uncapped** so a red-flag name far
  down the rank-IC sort is never silently dropped. Read-only and never
  raises — same operational discipline as the rest of `paper_trader/ml`:
  no `decision_scorer.pkl` / `build_features` / `N_FEATURES` / trade-path
  touch, safe under the live unattended continuous loop. CLI:
  `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.per_ticker_skill` with exit codes mirroring
  `sector_skill._cli` — `0` on `HEALTHY`/`NO_TICKER_EDGE`/
  `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, `1` on `SCORER_UNTRAINED`/other recoverable
  error, `2` on `HAS_INVERTED_TICKER` (a cron can branch on it).
- **Test-locked in `tests/test_per_ticker_skill.py`** (28 exact-value
  cases mirroring the `sector_skill` test shape): verdict thresholds at
  `IC_MIN`/`IC_GOOD`/`MIN_OUTCOMES_PER_TICKER`; universal SELL sign-flip
  on realized; non-finite / string / `None` `forward_return_5d` dropped;
  scorer-`predict` exception drops only that row; perfectly-correlated
  ticker → `rank_ic≈1.0` / `dir_acc=1.0` / `SIGNAL_EDGE`; anti-correlated
  ticker → `INVERTED_SIGNAL` and overall `HAS_INVERTED_TICKER`; inverted
  outranks no-edge in the overall verdict; ticker case normalised so
  mixed-case external rows bucket together; empty-ticker rows dropped;
  report capped at `MAX_TICKERS_IN_REPORT` with `tickers_truncated=True`
  but the `inverted_tickers` list stays complete; JSONL loader skips
  unparseable lines and non-dict tops; `analyze()` end-to-end against an
  empty file yields `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`; CLI exit codes 0/1/2 per verdict.

### `_VOLUME_CACHE` bounded LRU eviction (2026-05-19)

- **`paper_trader/backtest.py::_VOLUME_CACHE_DISK_LOADED` is now an
  `OrderedDict` (LRU bookkeeping), bounded to the most recent
  `_VOLUME_CACHE_MAX_WINDOWS = 16` (start, end) windows.** Before this
  pass, every continuous-loop cycle picked a fresh random window and the
  in-memory `_VOLUME_CACHE` / `_VOLUME_CACHE_DISK_LOADED` accumulated
  forever — roughly 30 quant-signal tickers × ~250 daily volumes × 8 bytes
  ≈ 60 KB / window; ~144 cycles / 24 h ≈ 8.6 MB / day, ≈ 60 MB / week of
  resident memory leaking with no clean release path on a 14 GB host.
- **LRU on access:** `_load_volume_cache_for_window` calls `move_to_end`
  when a previously-seen window is hit, so an actively-replayed window
  doesn't get evicted under the cap. New eviction helper
  `_evict_oldest_volume_windows_locked()` (called only under
  `_VOLUME_CACHE_LOCK`) drops both the bookkeeping entry AND every
  per-ticker series whose key matches the evicted (start, end) — memory
  is actually reclaimed, not just bookkeeping. On-disk caches at
  `data/backtest_cache/volumes_<start>_<end>.json` are untouched; a
  revisited window pays one disk read, not a yfinance fetch.
- **Test-locked in `tests/test_backtest.py::TestVolumeCacheBoundedLRU`:**
  `test_evicts_oldest_when_cap_exceeded` (eviction triggers at cap+1 and
  purges per-ticker series, not just the bookkeeping set),
  `test_access_refreshes_lru_order` (touching an old window moves it to
  most-recently-used so the next eviction drops a different victim).
  `conftest.py` and `tests/test_variable_windows.py` updated to seed an
  empty `OrderedDict()` instead of an empty `set()` for test isolation —
  same `key in …` / `len(…)` contract, plus the `move_to_end` /
  `popitem(last=False)` API the eviction helper needs.

### 52-week position outcome capture (2026-05-19)

- **`_compute_decision_outcomes` now additively records `wk52_pos`
  (0..1 trailing 52-week position) + `pct_from_52h`** alongside the
  existing quant features. Both are already computed by
  `_compute_technical_indicators` (`paper_trader/backtest.py`) and
  `wk52_pos` is the threshold driving `_ml_decide`'s **bubble-top BUY
  gate** (`wk52_pos > 0.80` → BUY suppressed; see invariant in
  `backtest._ml_decide`). Until this pass, neither value was persisted to
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` — so the documented bubble-top gate
  explanation could never be empirically checked against realized
  forward returns by any downstream tool. The capture is purely additive:
  `train_scorer`/`build_features` consume explicit kwargs and ignore
  extra dict keys, so the scorer pickle, `N_FEATURES`, and every existing
  OOS diagnostic are byte-identical (the `forward_return_10d/20d`
  precedent). Legacy outcome rows have no `wk52_pos` key; new rows
  populate from the next continuous cycle.
- **Honest None semantics.** When `_compute_technical_indicators` returns
  `None` for a ticker (history < 60 closes at sim_date), `wk52_pos` /
  `pct_from_52h` are captured as **`None`** in the outcome row — *not* a
  0.0 sentinel, which would be indistinguishable from a real
  ticker-at-52w-low signal and silently poison the gate-explanation
  analysis. Test-locked in
  `tests/test_continuous.py::TestWk52PosCapturedInOutcomes`:
  `test_wk52_pos_field_present_when_history_sufficient` (monotonic
  80-day fixture → `wk52_pos ≈ 1.0`, `pct_from_52h ≈ 0%`),
  `test_wk52_pos_is_none_when_history_insufficient` (synthetic_prices
  fixture's 51-day series → keys present, values `None`),
  `test_capture_does_not_break_existing_keys` (full schema regression
  lock: every previously-documented outcome field must still appear).

### Baseline-trend reader (2026-05-18)

- **`paper_trader/ml/baseline_trend.py` (new read-only diagnostic).**
  `_append_baseline_skill_log` (committed `6ade72d`) writes one row per
  cycle to `data/baseline_skill_log.jsonl` carrying the decisive
  `ic_gap = MLP_rank_ic − best_one_liner_rank_ic` column — but **nothing
  read it**. `skill_trend.py` trends the *scorer-skill* ledger
  (`oos_rmse` vs a constant mean-predictor); the baseline ledger, which
  captures the single most economically-decisive recurring finding
  (`MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` — a one-liner out-ranks the 17-feature MLP
  the conviction gate sizes on), had no trender. This is the exact
  ledger-wired-but-unread gap the pass-#17 `skill_trend` addition closed
  for the sibling ledger; `baseline_trend` is its counterpart. It loads
  the baseline ledger, takes the **median** `ic_gap` over the recent
  window (window-specific `ic_gap` noise is large — median, not mean),
  and returns an exact verdict. `IC_MARGIN` / `MLP_IC_MIN` are
  **imported from `baseline_compare`** (single source of truth — this
  trends *that* tool's per-cycle verdict, so the margins must match by
  construction; the `_oos_rank_metrics`-reuses-`_spearman` precedent).
  Verdicts (exact-value test-locked, `MIN_CYCLES=5`,
  `RECENT_CYCLES=10`): `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` (< 5 usable rows — a row is
  usable iff `status=="ok"` AND `ic_gap` is finite, so a scorer-untrained
  `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` cycle with `ic_gap=None` is correctly excluded,
  mirroring `skill_trend`'s null-`oos_rmse` skip) → `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL`
  (recent median `ic_gap ≤ −IC_MARGIN`) → `MLP_ADDS_SKILL` (recent median
  `ic_gap ≥ +IC_MARGIN` AND recent median `mlp_rank_ic > MLP_IC_MIN` —
  the same dual gate `baseline_compare.MLP_ADDS_SKILL` uses) →
  `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL` (otherwise). `trend`
  `IMPROVING/DEGRADING/STABLE/UNKNOWN` is recent-vs-older median `ic_gap`
  (higher = better). Also surfaces `most_common_best_baseline` (which
  one-liner keeps winning — on the live corpus this is `ml_score`, the
  decisive detail: the net destroys the signal it is fed),
  `gate_active_fraction`, and recent medians of `mlp_rank_ic` /
  `best_baseline_ic` / `n_train`. Read-only, never raises (same
  operational discipline as the rest of the module). CLI exit mirrors
  the sibling whose verdict it trends (`baseline_compare`): `0` on
  `MLP_ADDS_SKILL` / `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, `2` on
  `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` / `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL`, so a cron can
  branch on "the net *persistently* fails to earn its complexity". CLI:
  `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.baseline_trend`. Locked by
  `tests/test_baseline_trend.py` (24 exact-value cases: single-source

### Generalization-gap (val vs OOS) trender (2026-05-18)

- **`paper_trader/ml/overfit_gap.py` (new read-only diagnostic).** The
  scorer-skill ledger persists BOTH `val_rmse` (the random-split
  in-sample-ish error `train_scorer` reports) and `oos_rmse` (the
  temporal-holdout error). AGENTS.md cites `val_rmse ≪ oos_rmse` as
  *"textbook overfit"* repeatedly, and HEAD commit `5a0af2d`
  ("regularize DecisionScorer MLP — (32,16)+L2+early-stop kills the val≪oos
  overfit") exists solely to close that gap — yet **nothing trended the gap
  itself**: `skill_trend` verdicts `oos_rmse` vs a fresh mean-predictor
  baseline (only *reports* `recent_median_val_rmse` as a side metric, no gap
  verdict); `baseline_trend` verdicts `ic_gap` (a different axis). So a
  skeptical quant could not durably answer the one question `5a0af2d` is
  supposed to settle. This module does, with an exact verdict, off the same
  ledger (no `decision_outcomes.jsonl` read needed — both RMSEs are already
  persisted per cycle). The verdict is driven by the **ratio**
  `oos_rmse / val_rmse`, not the absolute `oos − val` pp: the loop draws
  random 1–10yr windows whose target σ varies several-fold, so an
  absolute-pp gap conflates regime σ with overfit; the ratio is scale-free.
  Aggregates the **median** ratio over the recent window (per-cycle ratio is
  noisy — one random window each). Reuses `skill_trend.load_skill_ledger` /
  `_median` / `MIN_CYCLES` / `RECENT_CYCLES` **verbatim** (single source of
  truth — the `baseline_trend`-imports-`baseline_compare` precedent; a
  ledger-schema change can never make this verdict and `skill_trend`'s
  disagree about which rows count). Verdicts (exact-value test-locked,
  module constants `SEVERE_RATIO=1.40`, `MILD_RATIO=1.15`,
  `RATIO_TOL=0.10`): `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` (< `MIN_CYCLES` usable rows — a row
  is usable iff `status=="ok"` AND `val_rmse` finite & > 0 AND `oos_rmse`
  finite, so the numpy-lstsq `val_rmse=NaN` fallback rows are correctly
  excluded) → `SEVERE_OVERFIT` (recent median ratio ≥ 1.40 — OOS error ≥40%
  above in-sample, the memorizing-net signature; the prior (64,32,16) net's
  oos≈16.7/val≈10.7≈1.56 sat here) → `MILD_OVERFIT` ([1.15, 1.40)) →
  `WELL_GENERALIZED` (< 1.15 — `5a0af2d`'s stated goal once it deploys).
  Boundaries inclusive at the lower edge (`>=`), matching `skill_trend`'s
  style. `trend` `IMPROVING/DEGRADING/STABLE/UNKNOWN` is recent-vs-older
  median ratio (lower = better). Surfaces `gate_active_fraction` (over ALL
  rows, like `skill_trend`): `SEVERE_OVERFIT` AND `gate_active=1.0` is the
  "underwriting sizing variance on a demonstrably memorized net right now"
  state. Read-only, never raises (same operational discipline as the rest
  of the module). CLI exit mirrors the sibling trenders so a cron can branch
  on "the net is *persistently* memorizing its training fold": `0` on
  `WELL_GENERALIZED` / `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, `2` on `MILD_OVERFIT` /

### Feature-coverage audit (2026-05-18)

- **`paper_trader/ml/feature_coverage.py` (new read-only diagnostic).** Every
  existing skill arbiter (`calibration` / `skill_trend` / `baseline_compare` /
  `feature_importance` / `regime_audit`) measures whether the *model* extracts
  skill from its inputs; **none ask whether the inputs carry any variation in
  the training data at all**. This is the upstream, decisive data-pipeline
  question — and `feature_importance` *structurally cannot* answer it: you
  cannot permute a near-constant column into measurable importance, so a dead
  feature reads as `0.0` importance identically to one the model merely
  ignores. `feature_coverage` disentangles "the model ignores a real signal"
  from "the signal was never in the data". Each `decision_outcomes.jsonl`
  record is pushed through the **exact** `build_features` call shape
  `train_scorer` uses (same kwargs, same clamps), and the per-slot default
  vector is derived by calling `build_features` with every numeric source
  `None` (single source of truth — a default change in `decision_scorer.py`
  cannot silently desync it; the `baseline_trend`-imports-`baseline_compare`
  precedent). Per numeric feature it reports `default_fraction` (rows whose
  post-`build_features` value equals the default), `distinct`, and a `dead`
  flag. Verdicts (exact-value test-locked, module constants `MIN_ROWS=30`,
  `DEAD_FLOOR=0.90`, `DEGRADED_FLOOR=0.50`): `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` →
  `DEAD_FEATURES_PRESENT` (≥1 feature default-substituted in ≥90% of rows OR
  constant <2 distinct) → `DEGRADED_COVERAGE` (no dead but ≥1 ≥50%) →
  `FULL_COVERAGE`. The 7-way sector one-hot is excluded (sparse *by
  construction* — exactly one hot per row — so a default fraction is
  meaningless there; `feature_importance` permutes it jointly for the same
  reason). Read-only, never raises (same operational discipline as the rest
  of the module). CLI exit mirrors the sibling diagnostics so a cron can
  branch on "the gate's MLP is being fed dead inputs right now": `0` on
  `FULL_COVERAGE` / `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, `2` on `DEAD_FEATURES_PRESENT` /
  `DEGRADED_COVERAGE`. CLI: `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.feature_coverage`.
  Locked by `tests/test_feature_coverage.py` (17 exact-value cases:
  single-source default identity · missing/corrupt JSONL load · all four
  verdict boundaries · constant-non-default dead rule · dead-overrides-
  degraded · never-raises on garbage field types · CLI exit codes · the live
  news-feature shape).

### Per-persona Sortino + Calmar (2026-05-18)

- **`persona_leaderboard._equity_risk` now also returns `sortino` and
  `calmar`** (commit `35735d9`). The module already computed a per-persona
  median **Sharpe**, max drawdown, and %-time-underwater off
  `equity_curve_json` — but Sharpe divides excess return by *total*
  volatility, so it penalises a persona for the large **upside** variance
  leveraged ETFs are bought for. That is precisely the wrong risk lens for
  this book: AGENTS.md repeatedly warns that "a single persona routinely
  posts +1000% … leveraged-beta dispersion through a cherry-able bull
  window, **not** repeatable alpha". Sharpe alone cannot tell a smooth
  leveraged compounder from a lucky volatile rip. The two metrics that can:
  - **Sortino** — `mean(daily_ret) / downside_dev × √252`, where
    `downside_dev` is the MAR=0 convention `sqrt(mean(min(r,0)²))` over
    **all** observations (not the std of just the negative subset). Only
    realised downside is penalised, so the leveraged right tail no longer
    counts against a persona.
  - **Calmar** — annualised return / worst peak→trough drawdown (the
    unrounded `max_dd` fraction). Return-per-unit-of-worst-pain — the
    metric a capital allocator actually cares about ("did +1000% earn its
    70% drawdown, or just ride a bull window?").
  Both share Sharpe's 252-day annualisation base and its
  degenerate-→-`None` discipline: no measurable downside ⇒ Sortino `None`
  (parallel to the zero-std Sharpe `None`); no drawdown / non-positive
  start / total wipe-out (`growth ≤ 0`) ⇒ Calmar `None` — an "infinite"
  ratio must never silently dominate the per-persona median.
  `persona_leaderboard` surfaces `median_sortino` / `median_calmar` per
  persona; the CLI gains both columns. **Read-only and additive** — no
  train, no `decision_scorer.pkl` / `decision_outcomes.jsonl` /
  `build_features` / trade-path touch; the DRAG/FLAT/EDGE verdict logic is
  **byte-identical** (Sortino/Calmar are informational like
  `sharpe`/`mdd`/`uw`, never verdict inputs — so every existing
  exact-value verdict lock is unchanged). Exact-value locked by
  `tests/test_persona_leaderboard_20260517.py::TestSortinoCalmar`
  (Sortino == 0.0 on a mean-zero curve; Sortino < 0 choppy-down;
  Sortino/Calmar `None` on no-downside / no-drawdown; **Calmar == 1.0
  exactly** on a constructed 20%-dd→recover 252-step curve where
  years = 252/252 = 1.0; Calmar sign tracks net P&L; Calmar `None` on a
  non-positive start; per-persona median aggregation incl. missing-curve
  robustness). The garbage-input exact-dict lock was strengthened to all
  five metrics.

consecutive no-new-bug review — two more zero-coverage seams found by
grepping every backtest symbol against `tests/`: **`BacktestStore.
run_detail`** — the read view behind `/api/backtests/<run_id>`; its
siblings `all_runs`/`run_curves` were locked the prior pass but
`run_detail` was not, despite real logic — missing-run → `None` (not
`{}`/raise, so the endpoint 404s not 500s), the `(sim_date ASC, id
ASC)` ordering on **both** child tables locked via an out-of-order
insert with a same-day pair (a `sim_date DESC` *or* `id DESC` tiebreak
regression scrambles the dashboard's trade/decision tables and fails
the exact-sequence assertion), corrupt-`equity_curve_json` → `[]`
degradation (a raise here 500s the endpoint), valid-curve round-trip;
**`backtest._sell`** the `SimPortfolio` mutator (distinct from
`strategy._sell`) — every backtest SELL / stop-loss / take-profit exit
routes through it yet it had **zero** direct unit coverage (only
transitive via `_enforce_risk_exits`/`_execute_decision`, which clamp
qty *before* calling it, so its own over-sell clamp and the
`pos["qty"] <= 1e-6` deletion boundary were never asserted in
isolation): no-position → `0.0` + no mutation, partial sell leaves
`avg_cost` untouched & credits cash == proceeds exactly (no rounding in
`_sell`), over-sell clamps to held qty & closes the row, the `1e-6`
epsilon boundary pinned both sides (residual 1e-7 → deleted, 1e-5 →
kept). The continuous-loop "old results are not overwritten without
version/timestamp" property is **not** re-tested here — it is already
locked by `test_store_runid_partial_seams.py`'s `upsert_run`
INSERT-vs-UPDATE seam above (a 2nd call for the same run_id changes
**only** `status`, preserving `seed`/`start_date`/`end_date`/
`start_value`/`started_at`)).

→ NO_BETTER case; the usable-row filter excluding both non-`ok` rows and
`status=="ok"` rows with `ic_gap=None` — the scorer-untrained
`INSUFFICIENT_DATA` cycle shape, mirroring `skill_trend`'s
null-`oos_rmse` skip; even-length `np.median` arithmetic pinned exactly
on a mixed `ic_gap`/`mlp_rank_ic`/`best_baseline_ic` set;
`most_common_best_baseline`; the trend axis proven independent of the

All tests are offline — `tests/conftest.py` redirects `SCORER_PATH`,
`PRICE_CACHE_PATH`, `BACKTEST_DB`, and the various cache paths to
`tmp_path` so a test run never clobbers real data. Synthetic deterministic
prices come from the `synthetic_prices` fixture. No test should reach the
network; if you add one that does, mock `yfinance.Ticker` (see
`test_variable_windows.py::_make_fake_hist`).

### Bug-fix workflow

For automated review agents that touch ML / backtest code:

1. **Read first**: `CLAUDE.md` §6 (the two-model section), this file's
   feature table, then the function you're about to edit. The invariants
   in `CLAUDE.md` §8 (especially #1 backtest live-only filter, #5 scorer
   gate threshold, #6 claude subprocess cap) are load-bearing.
2. **Be surgical**: prefer a 3-line edit over a refactor. The continuous
   loop runs unattended; cosmetic churn risks breaking pickle
   compatibility for `data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl` or schema
   compatibility for `data/decision_outcomes.jsonl`.
3. **Run tests before committing**:
   `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v 2>&1 | tail -20`. Failures block
   the commit.
4. **Append an entry to `data/run_log.md`** with the
   `## YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` header described at the top of that file.

### Common pitfalls

- **Pickle compatibility** — adding a feature to `build_features`
  invalidates `data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl`. The `predict()` exception
  handler now logs once per instance (was silent — masked exactly this
  case during a feature rollout). After a feature change, force a retrain
  by deleting the pickle before the next continuous-loop cycle.
- **`_to_float` and numpy types** — `np.float32` is *not* a Python `float`
  subclass (`np.float64` is). `_to_float` falls back to an **`np.number`**
  check (NOT `np.generic`: `np.generic` also matches `np.str_`/`np.bool_`,
  and `np.isfinite(np.str_("x"))` raises an *unhandled* `TypeError` that
  would propagate out of `build_features` and crash `train_scorer`; numpy
  strings/bools must take the safe default like Python `str`/`bool` do).
  If you add new numpy inputs, verify they pass through. It rejects
  every non-finite value (NaN **and** ±inf) on both the Python and numpy
  branches via `math.isfinite` / `np.isfinite` — this is load-bearing: a
  single `decision_outcomes.jsonl` row with a non-finite `forward_return_5d`
  poisons `train_scorer`'s `y` vector, `MLPRegressor.fit` raises, and
  `_train_decision_scorer` swallows it — silently wedging scorer retraining
  for that cycle and every cycle after (the row persists in the 5000-record
  tail). Pinned by `tests/test_decision_scorer.py::TestToFloat` +
  `::TestTrainScorer::test_handles_non_finite_forward_return`.
- **`dict.get(k, default)` does NOT default a JSON `null`** — it only
  substitutes the default when the key is *absent*; an explicit `null`
  value still returns `None`. `_inject_and_train` reads
  `winner_training.jsonl` (which mixes top-decision, opus-lesson and
  opus-trade-label record shapes) and a single line with `"ai_score": null`
  or `"weight": null` reaching `float(None)` raises `TypeError` — caught by
  the function's broad outer `except`, which returns `"inject err: …"` and
  injects **zero** rows that cycle, so ArticleNet never retrains. The fix
  is the codebase's standard `float(rec.get("ai_score") or 0.0)` /
  `… or 1.0` idiom (same class as the `_ml_decide`
  `float(a.get("score") or 0.0)` hardening). Pinned by
  `tests/test_ml_backtest_review.py::TestInjectAndTrain::test_null_ai_score_and_weight_do_not_abort_batch`.
  That test also locks the **11-column INSERT alignment** (id…full_text),
  `ai_score == kw_score == min(10, ai·weight)`, hard-coded `urgency=0`, and
  `INSERT OR IGNORE` dedup by `_aid(url, title)`.
  The same null-default class lives in `_ml_decide`'s article loop: it
  hardens **both** `score` (`float(a.get("score") or 0.0)`) **and**
  `tickers` (`list(a.get("tickers") or [])`). A `"tickers": null` makes
  `list(None)` raise an uncaught `TypeError` — unlike `_inject_and_train`
  there is **no** broad `except` here, so it kills the whole run thread
  mid-cycle (run recorded `failed`, zero decisions), the same blast radius
  the adjacent `score` hardening comment describes. Pinned by
  `tests/test_ml_backtest_review.py::TestMlDecideMalformedArticles` (None
  `tickers` ⇒ same decision as the well-formed article; None `score` ⇒
  clean HOLD, never an exception).
- **Hardcoded cross-repo paths must be module-level for testability** —
  `_inject_and_train` writes into digital-intern's `articles.db`. Its path
  is now the module constant `run_continuous_backtests.DIGITAL_INTERN_ARTICLES_DB`
  (was a function-local string, untestable). Tests monkeypatch it +
  `WINNER_JSONL` + `subprocess.run` to exercise the injection offline. Keep
  any new cross-repo path at module scope for the same reason.
- **`_enforce_risk_exits` trading-day membership is O(1)** —
  `cur not in prices.trading_days` was a list scan inside a per-calendar-day
  loop; over a 1–10yr continuous-loop window that is tens of millions of
  comparisons per run. It now snapshots `set(prices.trading_days)` once at
  function entry (behavior-identical — no PriceCache change, so the
  `synthetic_prices` fixture that builds `PriceCache` via `__new__` is
  unaffected). The SL/TP exit semantics it guards (stop-loss priority via
  `if sl … elif tp …`, full-qty liquidation, no double-fire after close)
  are locked by
  `tests/test_ml_backtest_review.py::TestEnforceRiskExitsSemantics`.
- **Forward leakage** — anything that reads news must filter on
  `url NOT LIKE 'backtest://%'` and `source NOT LIKE 'backtest_%'` /
  `'opus_annotation%'`. The live `signals.py` and the backtest
  `_load_local_articles` / `_query_news_context` already do this; new
  readers must mirror it.
- **Single sqlite3 connection across threads** — `BacktestStore.conn` is
  shared across run threads and the background `_opus_annotate` thread.
  Every read / write must hold `store._lock`. If you add a new query path,
  copy the locking pattern from `_trim_history` / `_append_top_decisions`.
- **Resolve module-global paths at call time, not as default args** —
  `def __init__(self, path=BACKTEST_DB)` binds the global's *value* at
  import, so conftest's `monkeypatch.setattr(bt, "BACKTEST_DB", tmp)` is a
  no-op for that call and the no-arg `BacktestStore()` silently hits the
  real persistent DB (this caused an order-dependent flaky test). Use
  `path=None` then `path = path or BACKTEST_DB` inside the body. Same rule
  for any new constructor that touches `SCORER_PATH` / `CACHE_DIR` / a
  cache path the conftest redirects. Locked by
  `tests/test_backtest.py::TestBacktestStoreIsolation`.
- **`SAMPLE_EVERY_N_DAYS = 1`** — backtests sample every trading day.
  Don't change this casually; the continuous loop's timing budget
  assumes a year-long sim completes in ~minutes per run.
- **Scorer-train status must stay truthful** — in
  `run_continuous_backtests.py::_train_decision_scorer`, `train_scorer()`
  pickles the model to `SCORER_PATH` and returns `status="ok"` *before* the
  temporal-OOS diagnostic runs. The OOS block (`DecisionScorer()` reload +
  `evaluate_scorer_oos`) has its **own** `try/except` that degrades to
  `oos_rmse=n/a (...)`. Do not collapse it back into the outer
  train `try/except`: a post-train diagnostic crash would then surface as
  `scorer err` on the operator-facing log/Discord even though the scorer is
  trained and the next cycle's singleton reset deploys it — a false
  "scorer broken / gate never engages" signal. Locked by
  `tests/test_continuous.py::TestTrainDecisionScorer::test_oos_eval_failure_does_not_mask_successful_train`.
- **Run-return weight is applied twice into the ArticleNet feed (by
  design, not a bug)** — `_append_top_decisions` folds the per-run weight
  `w = 0.5 + 0.5·(ret−min)/span` into the JSONL `ai_score`
  (`w·5.0` for BUY, `w·0.5` for SELL) *and* stores the bare `w` as
  `weight`. `_inject_and_train` then writes `eff = min(10, ai_score·weight)`
  into digital-intern's `articles.db`, so a top-run BUY lands at `≈5·w²`
  (`w∈[0.5,1.0] → eff∈[1.25,5.0]`) — the run-quality term is **squared**,
  intentionally compressing lower-ranked runs harder than a linear weight
  would. This only affects ArticleNet's training emphasis (a *separate*
  model in digital-intern), never the DecisionScorer or any trade. Opus
  annotation rows side-step it (`weight=1.0`, so `eff=ai_score`). Do not
  "linearise" this in a surgical pass — it perturbs ArticleNet training
  dynamics and is out of scope for the ML/backtest review.
- **The `_get_decision_scorer` `_Dummy` fallback is a load-bearing
  contract, not a stub** — when the real `DecisionScorer` import or
  instantiation raises, the singleton degrades to an inline `_Dummy`.
  `_ml_decide` then calls `scorer.predict(**kwargs)` with a **fixed
  11-keyword signature** (`ml_score, rsi, macd, mom5, mom20, regime_mult,
  ticker, vol_ratio, bb_pos, news_urgency, news_article_count`) and reads
  `scorer.is_trained` + `getattr(scorer, "_n_train", 0)`. If a refactor
  "tidies" the Dummy into a positional or arg-less `predict`, **every**
  parallel backtest run thread throws `TypeError` mid-cycle the moment the
  real scorer can't load (recorded `failed`, zero decisions) — a silent,
  total backtest outage that only manifests on the import-failure path the
  happy-path tests never take. Keep `def predict(self, **kw): return 0.0`,
  `is_trained = False`. Locked by
  `tests/test_ml_backtest_seams.py::TestDecisionScorerDummyFallback`.

### 2026-05-17 review pass (GDELT coverage · run reaper · OOS dir-skill)

- **GDELT permanent-vs-transient errors (`backtest.py::GDELTFetcher.fetch`,
  committed `8899c16`).** GDELT DOC 2.0 only indexes ~2017-onward; a
  pre-coverage date raises a *deterministic* `ValueError` ("The query was
  not valid … Invalid query start date"). The fetcher previously treated
  this as transient — 3 retries with 20+40+60s backoff **and no cache
  write**, so the continuous loop (windows back to 1993) re-attempted it
  every cycle for hours (`continuous.log` was wall-to-wall these). Now a
  permanent message (`"not valid"` / `"invalid query"`, matched on text not
  type) breaks with **zero backoff** and **negative-caches `[]`** so the
  warm-cache `exists()`-filter and the tier-3 disk lookup skip it forever
  after. Transient errors (rate-limit / connection drop) keep the full
  retry+backoff and are **never** cached (caching a transient failure would
  poison a temporarily-failing date for the loop's life). A
  legitimately-empty result on a *covered* date is still cached (unchanged).
  Locked by `tests/test_gdelt_coverage_20260517.py`.

- **Orphaned-run reaper (`run_continuous_backtests.py::_reap_orphaned_runs`,
  called once at `main()` startup; committed `05b4df2`).** A run thread
  hard-killed by OOM/SIGKILL never reaches `finalize_run` *or* the
  `run_all` wrapper's `upsert_run("failed")` (that fallback only fires on a
  *caught* exception), so the `backtest_runs` row stays `status='running'`
  forever — the CLAUDE.md §11 "Backtest dashboard shows running forever"
  symptom (15 such stale rows were live in `backtest.db`). On a fresh loop
  start any pre-existing `running` row is orphaned (prior process is gone);
  the `max_age_hours=6.0` guard is defensive (no real run exceeds minutes).
  Runs single-threaded before any new run launches — no race. Best-effort:
  a DB hiccup never blocks loop start. Locked by
  `tests/test_continuous_review_20260517.py::TestReapOrphanedRuns`.

- **OOS directional skill in the continuous-loop status line
  (`_oos_rank_metrics`, appended to `_train_decision_scorer`'s string as
  `oos_diracc=` / `oos_ic=`; committed `05b4df2`).** `oos_rmse` answers
  *how big is the error* but the `_ml_decide` gate only acts on the
  prediction's **sign/bucket** (±10/±5/0), so a scorer with
  `oos_rmse ≳ σ(target)` (the documented current state) can still be
  gate-useful **iff it gets direction right**. `oos_diracc` = held-out
  sign-match fraction (zeros excluded — no directional truth); `oos_ic` =
  tie-aware Spearman(pred, realized) **reusing `ml.calibration._spearman`**
  (single source of truth — the tie-awareness is load-bearing because the
  scorer clamps to ±50 and a naïve argsort fabricates rank skill there; a
  constant predictor must read `oos_ic=+0.00`, not +1.00). Mirrors
  `validation.evaluate_scorer_oos`'s exact 11-kwarg predict signature +
  SELL sign-flip so it describes the **same** path the gate uses. Guarded
  *separately* from the `oos_rmse` block (own try/except → `n/a`) so a
  post-train diagnostic crash can't mask a successful train (the
  "scorer-train status must stay truthful" discipline). **Interpretation:**
  read `oos_diracc` next to `oos_rmse` — `oos_diracc ≤ 0.5` with
  `oos_rmse ≳ σ` means the BUY-conviction gate is riding noise;
  `oos_diracc` materially > 0.5 is the only evidence the gate's sign
  decision carries edge despite the poor RMSE. Diagnostic only — changes no
  model/gate (training-dynamics is out of scope; CLAUDE.md §6). Locked by
  `tests/test_continuous_review_20260517.py::TestOosRankMetrics`.

### 2026-05-17 review pass #2 (label-hygiene audit · live findings)

Hybrid quant pass (debug + feature + live validation). **Zero code bugs
found** — 10th consecutive no-new-bug review of the ML/backtest core.
One read-only diagnostic added; the rest is reported live findings, not
silent fixes (every actionable item is a training-dynamics change the
doc repeatedly scopes out).

- **Training-label hygiene audit (`paper_trader/ml/label_audit.py`,
  committed `9c844c9`).** The exact read-only sibling of
  `ml/calibration.py`: no train, no pickle, no `decision_outcomes.jsonl`
  rewrite, no `build_features`/`N_FEATURES` touch — safe against the
  unattended loop. `PriceCache` fetches `yf.history(auto_adjust=False)`,
  so a reverse split (DFEN's 2024-06 1:5) injects a step discontinuity
  recorded as a `forward_return_5d` of **+180.04%** (`mom5=-64.04` — a
  textbook split signature). The inference head is clamped to
  `PRED_CLAMP_PCT`, but **nothing measured how many *labels* sit past
  that bound**, and `train_scorer`'s run-quality oversampling up-weights
  them 2–4×. The audit reports the extreme-label rate (`|fwd| >
  EXTREME_RETURN_PCT`, imported `== PRED_CLAMP_PCT` — single source of
  truth, the `_oos_rank_metrics`-reuses-`_spearman` precedent) vs the
  documented ~0.5% real baseline, plus per-ticker worst offenders and an
  *informational-only* directional-anomaly subcount (it also fires on
  genuine 2020-03 COVID mean-reversions, so it never drives the verdict).
  Verdicts `CLEAN`/`ELEVATED`/`CONTAMINATED` are exact-testable module
  constants; the `CONTAMINATED` hint points at the **documented**
  remediation (delete the pkl, let the loop retrain) and explicitly says
  *do NOT winsorize `y` in `train_scorer`* — that is the out-of-scope
  training-dynamics change this tool exists to inform, not perform.

  ```bash
  # Label hygiene of the accumulated outcomes tail (read-only).
  # Exit 0 = CLEAN/INSUFFICIENT, 2 = ELEVATED/CONTAMINATED.
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.label_audit
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_label_audit_20260517.py -v
  ```

  **Interpreting it (live finding).** On the current 5000-row corpus the
  aggregate is `CLEAN` (25/5000 = 0.500%, dead-on the documented
  baseline) — but the per-ticker view is the payoff: **DFEN 11/523 =
  2.10%** (4× the corpus rate), FAS 1.20%, MSTR 1.36%, all concentrated
  on reverse-split / COVID-crash dates. A corpus-wide `CLEAN` masks a
  per-name concentration the scorer's DFEN/FAS tail predictions ride on.
  Read this next to the `calibration` verdict, exactly like `oos_rmse`.
  Locked by `tests/test_label_audit_20260517.py` (exact verdict
  boundaries · strict `|fwd|>PRED_CLAMP_PCT` · single-source-of-truth ·
  non-finite drop · per-ticker sort · directional-anomaly-informational ·
  `_load_outcomes` corrupt-line skip).

- **Live finding — the running continuous loop is stale (NOT a code
  bug; operator action).** PID `1086675` started `02:21:35`; the GDELT
  permanent-error short-circuit (`8899c16`, `06:52`) and the
  orphaned-run reaper (`05b4df2`, `06:57`) were committed *after* it
  booted. Evidence it is running pre-fix code: `continuous.log` shows
  `Invalid query start date` errors still doing the full 3-retry
  20+40+60s backoff (the exact pathology `8899c16` removes), its
  `scorer ok …` lines lack the `oos_diracc=`/`oos_ic=` fields `05b4df2`
  adds, and `backtest.db` has **19 orphaned `running` rows** the
  startup reaper would have swept. Remediation is the documented
  `/api/build-info`-`stale` protocol: a clean SIGTERM between cycles +
  restart. Left for the operator — restarting a user-owned production
  loop is outward-facing and out of an automated pass's remit.

- **Live finding — `_llm_annotate_outcomes` has been structurally inert
  since deployment.** The `anthropic` SDK is importable but no
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/auth is configured (the whole system is `claude`
  CLI-subprocess-authed, not SDK), so every cycle logs
  `LLM annotation failed: Could not resolve authentication method` and
  `LLM labels: 0 endorsed, 0 condemned`. **All 5000 rows in
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` carry `llm_quality_label: 0`** — the
  `{1: 3.0, -1: 0.1, 0: 1.0}` training-weight multiplier in
  `train_scorer` (a documented load-bearing training feature — see the
  "Run-return weight" pitfall) has *never once been live*. Not fixed
  here: routing it through the `claude` CLI like `_opus_annotate`
  activates a 3×/0.1× sample-weight on the unattended loop — a
  training-dynamics change requiring an explicit decision + pkl bump,
  not a surgical edit. Reported for that decision.

- **Live finding — in-sample calibration is optimistic vs OOS.**
  `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.calibration` on the live pkl
  (`n_train=3876`) reports `WELL_CALIBRATED` (spearman 0.51, monotone
  deciles, 1.85pp decile error) — but the continuous loop's
  trustworthy temporal-holdout `oos_rmse` is **14.62** on the latest
  matching cycle (range 8.18–17.36 across recent cycles), straddling /
  exceeding the documented σ(aligned target) ≈ 11.7. The scorer's
  out-of-sample RMSE is at or worse than predicting the mean even
  though it gates BUY conviction once `_n_train ≥ 500`. Always pair the
  in-sample `WELL_CALIBRATED` with `oos_rmse` (and now `label_audit`) —
  the in-sample verdict alone overstates the edge. Backtests themselves
  are healthy (486 complete, 0 null/NaN finals, fresh `completed_at`),
  but the per-cycle "best run +1294% / vs_spy +1202%" line sits next to
  a same-regime "+12% / vs_spy −80%" — the documented leveraged-beta
  dispersion, not repeatable alpha.

### 2026-05-17 review pass #3 (per-persona strategy-quality leaderboard)

Hybrid quant pass (debug + feature + live validation). **Zero code bugs
found in the existing ML/backtest core** — 11th consecutive no-new-bug
review. One read-only diagnostic added (the third in the
`calibration.py` / `label_audit.py` family); the rest is reported live
findings.

- **Per-persona strategy-quality leaderboard
  (`paper_trader/ml/persona_leaderboard.py`).** The exact read-only
  sibling of `ml/calibration.py` and `ml/label_audit.py`: no train, no
  pickle, no `decision_outcomes.jsonl`/`backtest.db` write (opens
  `backtest.db` strictly `mode=ro`), no `build_features`/`N_FEATURES`
  touch — safe against the unattended loop. Two prior diagnostics
  measure **scorer** quality; nothing measured **strategy/persona**
  quality, despite `backtest.db` holding ~490 `complete` runs each
  mapped to one of 10 personas. It **imports `backtest.persona_for`**
  (single source of truth — the `_oos_rank_metrics`-reuses-`_spearman`
  precedent), so a `PERSONAS` reorder can never silently desync the
  historical aggregates. Per persona it reports the **median** vs_spy
  (the honest central tendency — the per-cycle "best run +1294%" line is
  the max of a leveraged-beta draw; the *mean* is dominated by a few 3×
  bull-window rips), win-rate vs SPY, median total return, and
  risk-shape from the stored `equity_curve_json` (max drawdown,
  annualised Sharpe-equivalent, %-time-underwater — none surfaced
  anywhere before). Per-persona verdicts `EDGE` / `FLAT` / `DRAG` /
  `INSUFFICIENT` and overall `HEALTHY` / `HAS_DRAG_PERSONA` are
  exact-testable module constants; the `HAS_DRAG_PERSONA` hint points
  at the *separate, explicit* prune/re-tune decision and explicitly says
  **do NOT** change `PERSONAS`/`_PERSONA_BOOSTS` from the read-only
  audit (the out-of-scope strategy-dynamics change this tool exists to
  inform, not perform — same discipline as `label_audit`'s
  do-not-winsorize hint).

  A **numerical-robustness gap in the new module itself** was caught by
  its own exact-value test before commit: a flat/cash-parked or
  constant-return equity stretch has a returns std of pure
  float-representation noise (~1e-16, because `0.1` is not exactly
  representable), which sails past a naïve `sd > 0` and divides a real
  mean by ~1e-17 → a ~1e16 "Sharpe" that would dominate the per-persona
  median. Fixed with a `sd > 1e-9` floor (any genuine daily-variance
  curve is ≫1e-9; the floor cleanly separates degenerate from real).

  ```bash
  # Per-persona strategy-quality leaderboard over the live backtest.db.

  ```

  **Interpreting it (live finding).** On the current ~490-run corpus the
  verdict is **`HAS_DRAG_PERSONA`**: 9 of 10 personas have a positive
  median alpha (Global Macro / Pure Speculator ≈ +96–101pp median, but
  with ~44–45% median max-drawdown and >90% time underwater — leveraged
  beta, not low-risk skill; Value Investor is the best risk-adjusted at
  Sharpe ≈ 0.79 / 27% maxDD / 92% win-rate), but **`Sector Rotator`
  (persona 7) is a `DRAG`: median vs_spy ≈ −1.9pp, mean ≈ −3.6pp,
  win-rate 45%, Sharpe ≈ 0.34 across 49 runs** — it does not beat SPY at
  the median and is contributing variance, not alpha. Its
  `_PERSONA_BOOSTS[7]` row (`FAS 2.5, DFEN 2.0, LABU 2.0, BOIL 1.5,
  XLE 2.0, XLF 2.0, XLI 1.5`) is the prime candidate for a future
  (separate, explicit, pkl/strategy-dynamics-aware) prune or re-tune —
  **reported, not actioned**, exactly like the pass #2 `_llm_annotate`
  finding. `ESG / Thematic` is the only other sub-EDGE persona (`FLAT`,
  median +16pp, below the +20pp strong bar). Read this next to the
  `calibration` and `label_audit` verdicts — it is the missing
  strategy-side measurement.

- **Live findings reconfirmed (operator action, NOT code bugs).** The
  pass #2 findings still hold on the running loop: `backtest.db` has
  **16 orphaned `running` rows** (the loop, PID 1086675 started 02:21,
  predates the `05b4df2` startup reaper — same documented `stale`
  protocol: clean SIGTERM + restart, left for the operator);
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` is at the **5000-row cap** with **every row
  `llm_quality_label: 0`** (the `_llm_annotate_outcomes` SDK-auth
  finding from pass #2 — the 3×/0.1× training-weight multiplier has
  still never been live); calibration on the live pkl (`n_train=3876`)
  is `WELL_CALIBRATED` in-sample (spearman 0.51) while the decile tails
  over-predict (d1 −15.7 vs −10.7; d10 +15.4 vs +11.9) — pair with
  `oos_rmse` as documented; `label_audit` is `CLEAN` aggregate (0.500%)
  with the same DFEN 2.10% per-ticker split concentration. Backtests are
  healthy (485–490 complete, 0 null/NaN finals, `completed_at` fresh to
  the current hour).

### 2026-05-17 review pass #4 (stale-mark surfacing · core hybrid pass)

- **Feature shipped (commit `f834c93`): stale price marks are now
  surfaced, not silent.** `_portfolio_snapshot` (strategy.py) already
  fell back to `avg_cost` when a live price was unavailable, so
  `current_price == avg_cost` and `unrealized_pl == $0.00` — **visually
  identical to a genuinely flat position**. Seen live this pass: `MU`
  held at `avg == mark == 724.12`, P/L `$0.00`, which Opus and the
  operator both read as "flat" when the mark was actually *unknown*. The
  snapshot now emits a `stale_mark: bool` on every enriched position
  (`True` only when the live stock/option-chain lookup returned `None`
  and we fell back; **`False` for a deliberate expired-option intrinsic
  settlement** — that is a real mark, not a missing price). `_build_payload`
  appends `[STALE MARK: live price unavailable — shown at cost, P/L
  unreliable]` to the PORTFOLIO line Opus reads (advisory text only — no
  gating, invariants #2/#12), and `reporter._portfolio_lines` appends an
  additive `⚠ STALE` tag. The reporter change is **byte-identical for the
  existing Discord path**: `store.open_positions()` table rows carry no
  `stale_mark` key, so a genuinely-flat `$0.00` is never falsely flagged;
  only a missing-price mark is. `stale_mark` also rides into
  `portfolio.positions_json` (via `update_portfolio`) so any `/api/state`
  / `/api/portfolio` consumer gets it for free. Applies on next
  paper-trader restart (the documented pattern for every recent feature).
  Locked by `tests/test_core_strategy.py::TestStaleMarkFlag` (stock
  no-price → flagged + behaviour preserved; stock with price → not stale;
  live option `None` → flagged + still avg_cost; expired-option intrinsic
  → NOT stale; `_build_payload` annotates the stale name and not the
  fresh one) and `tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestPortfolioLines`
  (annotated when flagged; absent/`False` key → no annotation).

- **No core bug fixed (bugs_fixed = 0, no Phase-1 commit).** The 7
  in-scope core files (`runner`, `reporter`, `signals`, `strategy`,
  `dashboard`, `market`, `store`) were re-audited for logic / race /
  comparison / off-by-one / state-transition errors against fresh eyes;
  none found. The `core_*` suite is green (293 passed incl. the 9 new
  tests; +165 in snapshot/payload-adjacent modules). Per the Phase-1
  commit guard, no bug was fabricated.

- **Live findings (operator action, NOT code bugs).**
  (1) **Claude org monthly usage limit hit** — runner.log shows repeated
  `claude err (rc=1): "You've hit your org's monthly usage limit"`;
  `/api/decision-health` reads **NO_DECISION 59% all-time / ~27% last
  24h**, FILLED only 3.2%, `hours_since_fill ≈ 9`. The trader degrades
  gracefully (Opus→Sonnet fallback→retry→`NO_DECISION` recorded with the
  raw excerpt; circuit breaker can't help a quota wall) but is mostly
  *not trading*. Operator must address billing.
  (2) **Hourly Discord summaries failing to send** — `[runner] hourly
  send returned False` recurring since ~16:54 UTC; the summary composes
  correctly (format verified: Equity/Cash/P&L/S&P/Positions/Recent/SESSION/
  BEHAVIOURAL) but `openclaw` fails during the quota window. Auto-retries
  next cycle (correct behaviour, not a bug).
  (3) **Running process is stale/behind** — `/api/build-info`
  `stale:true`, `boot_sha 92fcd2f` vs `head f834c93` (`behind:3`); the
  on-disk fixes incl. this pass's feature do **not** apply until an
  operator restart of `paper_trader.runner` (by design, surfaced
  correctly).
  (4) **Extreme concentration** — `/api/risk` `HIGH`: LITE 60.9% / top3
  98.1% / cash 1.9% ($18.49). By design (no hard limits, invariant #12)
  but a live-desk red flag worth the operator's eye.
  (5) **LITE/MU marked ~10× plausible levels** (LITE ~$970–1006, MU
  ~$724–803 vs real-world ~$80–130). The system is internally consistent
  (buy & mark from the same yfinance source) and yfinance returns `None`
  for them right now so it is unverifiable from here — but **position
  sizing runs on these marks**; the operator should verify
  `yfinance.fast_info` is not returning a wrong-instrument price.
  (6) **Dashboard intermittent multi-second stalls / `CLOSE-WAIT`
  pileup under concurrent sibling-agent load** (recovered to 1–11 ms on
  isolated requests). Documented fragility (`dashboard.py:176-187` —
  `yfinance`/`requests` has no socket timeout, a hung call pins an SWR
  worker). No safe in-scope fix; reported.

### 2026-05-17 review pass #5 (ML+backtest hybrid · poison-cache fix · skill-trend reader)

- **Bug fixed (commit `6e3fa55`): poisoned per-window price caches.**
  `PriceCache._load` accepted ANY cached `prices_*.json` whose `_meta`
  matched and tickers were a superset — **including the 34 of 177 (19%)
  live per-window caches whose SPY series is `{}`** from a transient
  yfinance failure at build time. `_build_trading_days` fell back to
  another ticker's calendar so the run completed, but
  `returns_pct("SPY",…)` then returned 0.0 → `vs_spy_pct` was fabricated
  (`== total_return`) with no real benchmark, and that feeds the live
  trader's `_ml_is_qualified` median-alpha gate (CLAUDE.md §15) every
  cycle the window is redrawn. The "Continuous-loop durability & honesty"
  note above flagged this "Still open … out of surgical scope" by bundling
  it with a strategy-side gate fix; the **cache-side half is surgical and
  in-domain**, so it was taken (the gate-side half stays in
  core/strategy.py — reported there, not actioned here).
  A paired benchmark-integrity guard in `_load` now (1) rejects a cached
  payload whose SPY series is empty when SPY is requested (SPY has data to
  its 1993 inception ⇒ an empty series is ALWAYS a transient fetch
  failure, never a real gap) and re-downloads, and (2) skips persisting a
  fresh download whose SPY series is still empty so the next draw retries
  rather than re-poisoning. Guard inert when SPY ∉ watchlist. The run
  still completes off the fallback calendar; `run_one` keeps writing the
  honest `benchmark_unavailable` note. The 34 on-disk poisoned files
  **self-heal on next redraw once the loop restarts on this code** (inert
  until restart — the documented restart-required pattern). Locked by
  `tests/test_pricecache_benchmark_poison.py` (both guard halves +
  healthy-cache-accepted + SPY-not-requested no-op);
  `test_integration_backtest.py::TestBenchmarkUnavailableNote` still green.

- **Feature shipped (commit `6a9eb66`): scorer-skill trend reader.**
  AGENTS.md called `data/scorer_skill_log.jsonl` *"the canonical
  instrument for the negative-OOS-skill question"* but there was **no
  reader** — a quant had to `tail` JSONL and eyeball it.
  `paper_trader/ml/skill_trend.py` answers it with an exact verdict
  (`INSUFFICIENT_DATA` / `BEATS_MEAN_PREDICTOR` / `NEGATIVE_OOS_SKILL` /
  `DIRECTIONAL_BUT_HIGH_ERROR` / `BORDERLINE`) plus `trend`
  (IMPROVING/DEGRADING/STABLE) and `gate_active_fraction`. The comparator
  baseline is computed **fresh** from the current `decision_outcomes.jsonl`
  temporal-OOS slice (reusing `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` + the
  SELL sign-flip) — NOT the regime-stale σ≈11.7 literal. RMSE of a
  constant mean-predictor == population σ of the OOS targets, so it is the
  exact regime-current comparator for the ledger's `oos_rmse`. Same
  discipline as `ml/calibration.py`: read-only, no train/pickle/feature/
  trade touch, never raises — safe against the live loop.
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.skill_trend
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_skill_trend.py -v
  ```
  17 exact-value verdict locks in `tests/test_skill_trend.py`.

- **Quant finding: the documented σ≈11.7 OOS baseline is regime-stale.**
  The fresh mean-predictor baseline on the *current* `decision_outcomes.jsonl`
  is **6.24** (temporal-OOS slice); the full 5000-row tail's realized 5d
  std is **7.49** — both far below the AGENTS.md σ≈11.7. The 3 ledger
  cycles since the loop restarted show `oos_rmse` ≈ 7.85/7.87/10.36 with
  `oos_ic` ≈ −0.0/0.10/−0.03. So the **relative** conclusion holds (oos
  error ≥ a mean predictor, ~zero rank-IC ⇒ no demonstrated OOS skill) but
  every **absolute** figure in the "negative-OOS-skill" note above is
  outdated — read `skill_trend` for the live numbers, not the literals.

- **Quant finding: scorer overfits (in-sample optimistic).** Live pkl
  `n_train=3283`, gate active. Calibration in-sample is `WELL_CALIBRATED`
  (spearman 0.48, monotone deciles, 1.59pp mean decile err) and sampled
  in-sample sign accuracy is **0.61**, but the ledger's OOS `dir_acc` ≈
  0.50 and `oos_ic` ≈ 0 — the in-sample/OOS gap is the overfitting
  signature. Decile tails over-predict by ~6pp (d10 pred +12.7 vs
  realized +6.9). The gate modulates real BUY conviction on a signal with
  near-zero demonstrated OOS edge; trust sign modestly, distrust the
  predicted magnitude. Reported, not actioned (model-dynamics change is
  out of surgical scope — CLAUDE.md §6).

- **Quant finding: pre-2020 windows trade a drastically narrowed
  universe.** Every 2x/3x single-stock leveraged ETF
  (NVDU/MSFU/AMZU/TSLT/CONL/TSLL/PLTU/BITU/BITX/ETHU/LNOK) and crypto-lev
  name returns `possibly delisted; no price data` for windows before its
  inception — handled gracefully (`prices[t]={}`), **not a code bug**, but
  a backtest-realism caveat: an old-window persona's return reflects a
  smaller, less-levered universe than the live watchlist, so its
  `_PERSONA_BOOSTS` leveraged-ETF tilts are partly inert there.

- **Live health.** 480 complete / 15 failed (all `[reaped: orphaned
  running row]` — the per-cycle reaper works) / 5 running (1.6h, under the
  6h guard). 0 NaN/null finals, 0 currently `benchmark_unavailable`-flagged
  (trimmed window). avg `vs_spy` +97.4% over 480 runs with same-window
  spread −39%→+40%+ (runs 6181–6185, 2009–2013) — leveraged-beta
  dispersion, not alpha, exactly as documented. Continuous loop is on
  stale code (predates this session's commits) — both shipped changes are
  inert until `run_continuous_backtests.py` restart.

### 2026-05-17 review pass #6 (ML+backtest hybrid · per-persona decision-signal skill · live findings)

- **Feature shipped: per-persona decision-signal-skill diagnostic.**
  `paper_trader/ml/persona_leaderboard.py` answers persona quality at the
  *run-return* level — but AGENTS.md is emphatic that the per-run number is
  leveraged-beta luck, not skill. There was **no decision-level**
  per-persona view: does a persona's own signal (`ml_score`) actually
  rank-predict the realized 5d outcome it acted on, or is its return pure
  beta noise? `paper_trader/ml/persona_skill.py` answers exactly that.
  For each persona (run_id→persona via the single-source-of-truth
  `backtest.persona_for`) it computes `score_ic` = tie-aware
  Spearman(action-aligned `ml_score`, action-aligned `forward_return_5d`),
  reusing `calibration._spearman` (single source of truth — cannot drift
  from the in-sample calibration metric; tie-awareness load-bearing because
  reasoning-parsed `ml_score` ties heavily at the persona buy threshold).
  The SELL convention is the codebase-universal target sign-flip applied
  **symmetrically** to the signal too, so "higher signal ⇒ higher realized
  goodness" is monotone across BUY/SELL. Verdicts per persona:
  `INSUFFICIENT` / `NO_SIGNAL_EDGE` / `WEAK_SIGNAL_EDGE` / `SIGNAL_EDGE` /
  `INVERTED_SIGNAL`; overall `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` / `NO_PERSONA_EDGE` /
  `HAS_INVERTED_PERSONA` / `HEALTHY`. Same discipline as
  `ml/calibration.py` / `ml/skill_trend.py` / `ml/persona_leaderboard.py`:
  read-only, no train / pickle / `build_features` / `N_FEATURES` / trade
  touch, never raises; it does **not** prune `PERSONAS` or re-tune
  `_PERSONA_BOOSTS` (a strategy-dynamics decision it only *informs*). CLI
  exits 2 if any persona is `INVERTED_SIGNAL` (operator/cron branchable,
  like `persona_leaderboard._cli`).
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.persona_skill
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_persona_skill.py -v
  ```
  16 exact-value verdict/arithmetic locks in `tests/test_persona_skill.py`.

- **Quant finding (live, actionable): 4 of 8 personas have no decision-
  signal edge.** Run against the live `decision_outcomes.jsonl` (6782
  aligned outcomes): GARP `score_ic +0.24` and Value Investor `+0.15`
  carry real `SIGNAL_EDGE`; Sector Rotator (n=1470) `+0.11` and ESG
  (n=2158) `+0.08` are only `WEAK_SIGNAL_EDGE`; **Small/Mid Cap (n=1372)
  `-0.01`, Contrarian `-0.05`, Momentum `-0.06`, Global Macro `-0.09` are
  `NO_SIGNAL_EDGE`** — i.e. the two highest-*volume* personas have weak
  edge and four personas' returns are pure leveraged-beta dispersion, not
  signal skill (overall verdict `HEALTHY` only because ≥1 persona has edge
  and none is inverted). This is the decision-level confirmation of the
  repeatedly-documented "read `vs_spy_pct` skeptically" thesis. Reported,
  **not actioned** — pruning/re-tuning `_PERSONA_BOOSTS` is a
  strategy-dynamics decision out of surgical scope (CLAUDE.md §6).

- **Bug audit: bugs_fixed = 0, no Phase-1 commit.** `decision_scorer.py`,
  `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py` re-audited (math:
  `_rsi`/`_macd`/`_ema` offsets, MACD signal alignment, BB/momentum
  windows; `train_scorer` dedup/sign-flip/oversampling; outcome
  parsing/regex; locking; atomic writes). No new safe surgical bug found
  after five prior passes — per the commit guard, none fabricated.

- **Quant finding (live, reported — not a surgical fix): `_llm_annotate_
  outcomes` has NEVER worked in production.** `continuous.log` shows
  `[continuous] LLM annotation failed: "Could not resolve authentication
  method…"` on **20/20** cycles, paired with `LLM labels: 0 endorsed, 0
  condemned`. Root cause: the function constructs `anthropic.Anthropic()`
  (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, unset — the box authenticates the `claude`
  CLI via a user session, not an SDK key), while **every other LLM call in
  the codebase** (`_opus_annotate` 100 lines below, `backtest._claude_call`)
  uses `subprocess.run(["claude","--model",…,"--print","--permission-mode",
  "bypassPermissions"])` which works. Consequence: `llm_quality_label` is
  `0` on **all 6782** rows of `decision_outcomes.jsonl` — the documented
  3×-endorse / 0.1×-condemn `train_scorer` sample-weighting
  (AGENTS.md "Common pitfalls") has applied **zero** times in this
  dataset's history; the feature is dead. **Recommended fix (operator
  decision, deliberately NOT actioned here):** port `_llm_annotate_
  outcomes` to the proven `subprocess claude --print` transport like
  `_opus_annotate`. It is left as a finding because enabling a dormant
  3×/0.1× reweight on the live unattended scorer is a training-dynamics
  change — it would create a mixed-regime training set (6782 historic
  label-0 rows + newly-labeled rows) and warrants a deliberate decision +
  pickle reset, exactly the "report, don't action model dynamics in a
  surgical pass" discipline this file applies to the trainer-timeout and
  negative-OOS-skill findings.

- **Quant finding (reconfirmed live): scorer gates real conviction on a
  near-zero-edge signal.** `skill_trend` = `BORDERLINE` (recent median
  `oos_rmse` 10.96 vs fresh mean-predictor baseline 10.18; `oos_ic` ≈
  0.02, `oos_dir_acc` ≈ 0.51 — a coin flip), yet `gate_active=1.0` across
  all 7 ledger cycles (`n_train` 2972–3852 ≥ 500). In-sample calibration
  `DIRECTIONAL_BUT_BIASED` (spearman 0.38, monotone, decile error 3.0pp):
  the tails massively over-predict — d1 pred −18.3 vs realized −7.8, d10
  pred +14.9 vs +8.4 (~2× magnitude inflation, the documented
  extrapolation the `off_distribution` gate-abstention guards). Reported,
  not actioned (model-dynamics, out of surgical scope).

- **Live health.** backtest.db: 480 complete / 15 failed (all
  `[reaped: orphaned running row]` — per-cycle reaper works) / 10 running.
  0 NaN/null finals, 0 `benchmark_unavailable`-flagged. 7 scorer-skill
  ledger cycles all `status=ok`. Runs 6166–6170 stuck `running` ~4h
  (orphaned by a loop restart; **within** the 6h reap guard, will be
  reaped — not a new bug). External-only noise in `continuous.log`: GDELT
  `ConnectTimeout`/`ConnectionReset` (handled w/ backoff), SEC EDGAR HTTP
  500s, `GOOGU` yfinance 404 (`prices[t]={}`) — all graceful. Both shipped
  changes are inert until `run_continuous_backtests.py` restart (the
  documented restart-required pattern).

### 2026-05-18 review pass #7 (ML+backtest hybrid · conviction-gate effectiveness audit · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bugs.** Full re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`,
  `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py`, plus the coupled
  `validation.py` / `calibration.py` / `skill_trend.py`: regex `ml_score`
  parse (no `scorer=` false-match), `(ticker,sim_date,action)` dedup key,
  the universal SELL `-forward_return_5d` sign-flip, the 5-trading-day
  forward window guard, the off-distribution gate abstention, the WLS
  numpy-fallback math, and every module-global lock were all re-verified
  correct and exact-value test-locked. Consistent with the documented 9+
  prior no-new-bug passes. **bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit** (commit
  guard honoured).

- **Feature shipped: conviction-gate effectiveness audit.**
  `paper_trader/ml/gate_audit.py`. The gap it fills: `calibration.py`
  answers a *statistical* question (is pred monotone with realized, bucketed
  by 10 quantile deciles) and `skill_trend.py` answers an *error-trend*
  question (oos_rmse vs a mean predictor) — **neither answers the economic
  one a quant asks before risking capital: do the five FIXED conviction
  multipliers `_ml_decide` applies (×0.60 / ×0.85 / ×1.00 / ×1.15 / ×1.30
  at FIXED prediction thresholds) actually buy realized edge?** A
  `WELL_CALIBRATED` decile curve can coexist with a gate whose ×1.30 arm
  realizes no more than its ×0.60 arm. `gate_audit` buckets every
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` row by the exact `_ml_decide` gate arm the
  deployed scorer's prediction triggers (the if/elif chain reproduced
  byte-for-byte, boundary operators included — duplicated as `GATE_ARMS`
  module constants exactly as `calibration`/`skill_trend` avoid the
  `backtest.py` circular import), applies the codebase-universal SELL
  sign-flip, restricts to the **temporal-OOS slice** by default
  (`validation.split_outcomes_temporal` — the trustworthy view), and
  verdicts on the realized spread the 1.30/0.60 ratio is implicitly
  underwriting: `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` / `GATE_HARMFUL` (spread < −1pp — gate
  sizes UP the losers) / `GATE_INEFFECTIVE` (|spread| ≤ 1pp) /
  `GATE_EFFECTIVE` (spread > +1pp). Same discipline as `ml/calibration.py`:
  read-only, no train / pickle / `build_features` / `N_FEATURES` / trade
  touch, never raises — safe against the live unattended loop.
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.gate_audit
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_gate_audit.py -v
  ```
  25 exact-value verdict/boundary locks in `tests/test_gate_audit.py`
  (gate-arm boundary operators mirror `_ml_decide`; SELL-flip regression
  lock; OOS-slice restriction; non-finite/missing-field hardening).

- **Quant finding: the live conviction gate is economically inert (and
  partially inverted).** `gate_audit` on the live pkl (`n_train=3446`,
  gate active) over the temporal-OOS slice (n=1000):

  | arm | mult | n | mean realized 5d |
  |-----|------|---|------------------|
  | strong_headwind | ×0.60 | 59 | **+2.09%** |
  | mild_headwind | ×0.85 | 483 | −0.12% |
  | neutral | ×1.00 | 304 | +0.79% |
  | mild_tailwind | ×1.15 | 109 | +1.88% |
  | strong_tailwind | ×1.30 | 45 | +3.07% |

  Verdict `GATE_INEFFECTIVE`: strong_tailwind − strong_headwind = **+0.98pp**
  (inside the ±1pp band) — a >2× capital swing buys ≈1pp of edge, noise
  against σ≈7–17 on 5d returns. Worse, the **tailwind half is monotone
  (0.79 → 1.88 → 3.07) but the headwind half is inverted**: the gate's
  *smallest* bet (strong_headwind ×0.60) realized the *second-highest*
  return (+2.09%), above neutral and mild_headwind. The ×0.60 down-sizing
  arm fires on the over-predicted d1 tail (calibration: d1 pred −9.63 vs
  realized −3.74 in-sample) and is mis-sizing names that don't deserve it.
  This is the missing economic complement to the existing split:
  `calibration` = `WELL_CALIBRATED` (in-sample, optimistic),
  `skill_trend` = `NEGATIVE_OOS_SKILL`, `gate_audit` = `GATE_INEFFECTIVE`.
  Reported, not actioned — re-sizing the multipliers or gate thresholds is
  a model-dynamics change out of surgical scope (CLAUDE.md §6; the gate is
  invariant #5).

- **Quant finding: the winner→ArticleNet feedback loop (CLAUDE.md §5
  step 5) is dead, now two ways.** Recent `continuous.log` `[continuous]
  ml:` lines are uniformly `trainer timeout (injected N)` **or**
  `inject err: database is locked`. AGENTS.md already documented the 120 s
  `ml.trainer.train(force=True)` timeout; the **`database is locked`** on
  the `_inject_and_train` write is a second, distinct failure (the live
  digital-intern daemon and the injector contend on `articles.db` — the
  injector opens a plain `sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH, timeout=15)` with no WAL
  pragma, unlike the read paths). Net: injection partially lands or is lost,
  ArticleNet never retrains from winners. Root cause is digital-intern-side
  (GPU contention + write contention) — reported, out of this domain's
  surgical scope, but the loop should not be read as "training on its
  winners" — it is not.

- **Quant finding: `[price_cache] XLI failed: 'Response' object has no
  attribute 'get'`** — an intermittent yfinance internal error during the
  per-window price-cache build leaves `prices["XLI"] = {}` (handled by the
  `except` — **not a code bug**). Consequence: `_sector_rotation` silently
  drops XLI from that cycle's rotation ranking and the XLI quant features
  no-op. Transient/network, self-heals on next redraw; noted as a
  data-realism caveat, not actioned.

- **Operational finding: hourly review agents are stacking.** Three
  identical-prompt ML+backtest review processes were observed running
  concurrently (started 06:00 / 06:30 + this pass), each taking >1 h, so
  `scripts/hourly_review.sh` overlaps itself. The working tree already
  carried another agent's uncommitted `run_curves` IN-clause chunking edit
  to `backtest.py`; to avoid sweeping it into this pass's commit, this pass
  touched **only new files** (`paper_trader/ml/gate_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_gate_audit.py`) plus this AGENTS.md section. Consider a
  lockfile / `flock` in `hourly_review.sh` so a still-running review skips
  rather than stacks.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #8 (ML+backtest hybrid · permutation feature-importance · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bugs.** Full re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`,
  `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus the coupled
  `validation.py` / `calibration.py`: the `score=` vs `scorer=` regex
  disambiguation (first-match is `score=N`, `scorer=` has no `score=`
  substring — re-verified), the universal SELL `-forward_return_5d`
  sign-flip symmetry train↔inference, the 11-column `_inject_and_train`
  INSERT alignment, `_to_float`'s `np.number` (not `np.generic`) branch,
  the `score`/`tickers` null-default hardening class, the
  `_train_decision_scorer` separately-guarded OOS blocks, and
  `_parse_scorer_status`'s `(?:^|\s)key=` token regex were all re-verified
  correct and exact-value test-locked. Consistent with the documented 10+
  prior no-new-bug passes. **bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit** (commit
  guard honoured — a clean 299/0 ML/backtest baseline, not a fabricated
  fix).

- **Feature shipped (commit `40715a7`): permutation feature-importance
  diagnostic.** `paper_trader/ml/feature_importance.py`. The gap it fills:
  `calibration` answers *is pred monotone with realized* (statistical),
  `skill_trend` answers *is oos_rmse better than a mean predictor*
  (error-trend), `gate_audit` answers *do the 5 fixed multipliers buy
  realized edge* (economic) — **none answers WHICH of the 17 features
  carries (or fails to carry) the prediction.** That is the natural quant
  question once the gate is known to be `GATE_INEFFECTIVE` /
  `NEGATIVE_OOS_SKILL`: is the model blind, sector-memorizing, or reading
  real signal that just doesn't generalize? `feature_importance` permutes
  each logical feature across the temporal-OOS slice (the 7-way sector
  one-hot permuted **jointly** via the `ticker` field so
  `build_features.SECTOR_MAP` stays the single source of truth — permuting
  one one-hot slot would fabricate importance), re-predicts through the
  **same** `scorer.predict` path `_ml_decide`'s gate uses, and reports
  `rmse_increase` / `rank_ic_drop` / `dir_acc_drop` per feature (the gate
  acts on sign *and* magnitude, so all three). Verdicts: `UNTRAINED` /
  `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` / `FLAT` / `SECTOR_DOMINATED` / `SECTOR_LEANING` /
  `SIGNAL_GROUNDED`. **Honesty guard:** a column with < 2 distinct non-null
  values on the slice is flagged `degenerate` (nothing to permute) and can
  never be `material`, so a *sparsity* 0.0 is never misread as "the model
  ignores this feature". Same discipline as `ml/calibration.py`: read-only,
  no train / pickle / `build_features` / `N_FEATURES` / trade touch, never
  raises, reuses `calibration._spearman` + `validation.split_outcomes_
  temporal`. CLI exits 2 on `SECTOR_DOMINATED` / `FLAT` (operator/cron
  branchable, like `label_audit` / `persona_skill`). It is a CLI / `ml/`
  reader, **not** wired into `main()` — zero deploy-stale impact, no loop
  restart needed (unlike a wiring change). 13 exact-value locks in
  `tests/test_feature_importance.py` (ignored-feature == exactly 0.0 on all
  three metrics; SECTOR_DOMINATED via a sector-only fake; FLAT via a
  constant predictor; SELL sign-flip regression; OOS-slice restriction;
  degenerate flag; never-raises on raising/NaN/untrained/too-few).
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.feature_importance
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_feature_importance.py -v
  ```

- **Quant finding (NEW, the headline): the scorer's near-zero OOS skill is
  NOT sector-memorization or label contamination — it leans hardest on
  genuine quant mean-reversion features that just don't generalize.** Live
  pkl `n_train=3446`, gate active, OOS slice n=1000. Verdict
  `SIGNAL_GROUNDED`, ranked by `rmse_increase`: **rsi +3.80, bb_position
  +3.24, mom5 +2.08, mom20 +1.83**, ml_score +0.70, **sector only #6 at
  +0.58**, macd +0.49, vol_ratio +0.14, regime_mult +0.08. So the model is
  reading classic RSI/Bollinger/short-momentum mean-reversion *hard*, and
  the sector one-hot — the suspected DFEN/FAS extreme-label memorization
  vector — is near the bottom. Yet `gate_audit`=GATE_INEFFECTIVE,
  `skill_trend`=NEGATIVE_OOS_SKILL (oos_rmse 10.96 vs fresh mean-predictor
  baseline 6.90, oos_ic 0.02, dir_acc 0.51), `calibration`=WELL_CALIBRATED
  *in-sample only* (tails inflate ~2.6×: d1 pred −9.63 vs realized −3.74).
  **The diagnosis this narrows to: the scorer reads real quant signal that
  carries no out-of-sample edge in this leveraged-ETF-heavy universe —
  "signal with no OOS edge", not "blind / sector-memorizing".** A more
  actionable framing for a future model-dynamics decision than the prior
  passes could establish. Reported, not actioned (model-dynamics / CLAUDE.md
  §6).

- **Quant finding (NEW): 2 of the 17 scorer inputs are structurally dead in
  the gate-relevant slice.** `news_urgency` / `news_article_count` are null
  for **100% of the OOS slice** (122/5000 non-null in the full corpus;
  `news_urgency` has only **1 distinct value** corpus-wide). They feed
  `build_features` slots 8–9 as the constant defaults (50.0 / 1.0) on every
  live gate decision. Root cause is the already-documented dead
  `_llm_annotate_outcomes` + the sparsity of parsed `news_count`/`news_urg`
  reasoning tokens (`_compute_decision_outcomes` nulls them when
  `news_count<=0`, which is almost always). The new tool surfaces this
  honestly via `degenerate` rather than letting a reader conclude "the model
  ignores news". Quantified here for the first time; not actioned (removing
  features is an `N_FEATURES`/pickle-breaking model-dynamics change —
  CLAUDE.md §6 / "When to bump model versions").

- **Live health.** `backtest.db`: 480 complete / 15 failed (all
  `[reaped: orphaned running row]` — startup reap logged `reaped 15`) / 10
  running. 0 NaN/null finals, 0 `benchmark_unavailable`-flagged (trimmed
  window). vs_spy over 480 complete: median **+37.6%**, min −170%, max
  +2820% — textbook leveraged-beta dispersion, not alpha, exactly as
  documented. 9 scorer-skill ledger cycles all `status=ok`, `gate_active=1.0`.
  Loop is on recent code (per-cycle reaper + `oos_diracc`/`oos_ic` present,
  no stale-code pattern) — both this and prior shipped diagnostics are
  inert-by-design `ml/` readers, **no restart needed**. Runs 6166–6170
  `running` 6.6 h: just crossed the 6 h reap guard, the next per-cycle
  mid-loop reap sweeps them — expected self-healing, **not a bug**.

- **Operational finding (reconfirmed, out of scope): winner→ArticleNet
  feedback loop dead two ways every cycle.** `[continuous] ml:` lines are
  uniformly `trainer timeout (injected N)` or `inject err: database is
  locked`; a separate `engine init failed … sqlite3.OperationalError:
  locking protocol` traceback appears intermittently (gracefully handled —
  `main()` logs it, `sleep 30`, `continue`). All three share one root
  cause: `backtest.db` is a symlink onto a removable/networked volume
  (`/media/zeph/projects/...`) whose SQLite WAL locking is contended by the
  live digital-intern daemon + the injector. ArticleNet never retrains from
  winners. Digital-intern-side + infra; reported, not actioned (matches
  pass #6/#7 findings — the loop should not be read as "training on its
  winners"; it is not).

### When to bump model versions

The scorer model has no explicit version field. Treat a change to
`N_FEATURES`, `SECTORS`, or `build_features` parameter signature as a
breaking change: delete `data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl` and let the next
continuous cycle retrain from `data/decision_outcomes.jsonl`. The pickle
auto-recreates atomically (`.pkl.tmp` → `replace`) so a fresh-start
deletion is safe even if a backtest thread is mid-read.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #9 (paper-trader core hybrid · /api/drawdown invariant-#12 + drawdown CLI · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — 2 bugs fixed (commit `d5d00fe`).**
  1. **`drawdown_api()` did not thread `INITIAL_CASH`.** It called
     `compute_drawdown(eq, positions)` with no `starting_equity`, silently
     relying on the builder's hardcoded `1000.0` default — the exact
     invariant-#12 violation `benchmark_api`/`analytics_api`/
     `reporter._INITIAL_EQUITY` are explicitly written to avoid (the
     `analytics_api` "a literal here silently desyncs Calmar if
     INITIAL_CASH" comment). On a fresh/empty equity curve `/api/drawdown`
     reported peak/trough/current at a literal 1000 and always echoed a
     wrong `starting_equity` if `INITIAL_CASH` ever moved. Fixed:
     `compute_drawdown(eq, positions, starting_equity=INITIAL_CASH)`.
  2. **`compute_drawdown` empty-curve fallback omitted `starting_equity`
     + `trough_pct`** that the populated branch returns — an inconsistent
     response shape that hands the dashboard card / decision-context fold
     `undefined` on a day-one book. Surfaced *by writing the real-logic
     test*, not by inspection. Both keys added for shape parity.
  - New `tests/test_drawdown.py` (`drawdown.py` previously had **no**
    test file): hand-computed peak/trough/recovery math,
    trough-resets-on-new-peak, at-high-water 1bp boundary, contributor
    sort + zero-cost-basis guard, history tail-pin, and the endpoint
    regression lock (FAILS against pre-fix code). 12 tests; 327-test core
    suite green.

- **Phase 2 — feature shipped (commit `dd9af44`): `python -m
  paper_trader.analytics.drawdown [--json]`.** Drawdown — depth, time
  underwater, what's dragging, how much clawed back — is a top-of-mind
  live-trader risk question with no terminal access, while every peer risk
  module (`benchmark`, `desk_pulse`, `model_reliability`,
  `decision_context`, `signals --check-freshness`) ships a CLI for exactly
  the case that is **live right now**: `/api/build-info` `stale:true
  behind:11`, so `/api/drawdown` serves *pre-fix* code until a runner
  restart. Thin read-only `__main__` (the `benchmark.py` precedent
  verbatim — `?mode=ro`, `INITIAL_CASH` threaded so the CLI honours
  invariant #12 too, `--json` | one-screen human digest with badge +
  peak/trough/recovery + top draggers). Verified live: `IN DRAWDOWN
  −3.46% / −$34.90, 84.8h in DD, LITE drag`. 2 subprocess end-to-end
  locks (skipped where no live DB).
  - **Concurrency note:** `dd9af44` also contains 2 `digital-intern`
    files a *sibling agent staged into the shared git index* between this
    agent's `git add` and `git commit` — `git commit` commits the whole
    index, not just what you `git add`. The per-commit "stage only your
    files" guard is **insufficient under a concurrent writer**; use
    pathspec-limited `git commit -- <files>` (race-immune). No code lost;
    the sibling's work is valid and intact, just bundled under this
    message.

- **Phase 3 — live findings (trader perspective, 2026-05-18 ~02:40 UTC).**
  1. **Running :8090 is 11 commits stale** (`build-info` `behind:11
     stale:true`). Concrete cost: `/api/model-reliability` 404s and every
     fix/endpoint committed today (incl. the drawdown invariant-#12 fix)
     is inert until **the runner is restarted**. The dominant operator
     action item.
  2. **Capital paralysis live & severe:** cash $18.49 (1.9% of $972.69),
     ~25 cycles since last fill, deployed ~98%, top-1 concentration 60.8%
     (LITE) `severity HIGH`. ~17h of `HOLD LITE`; Opus cannot act on a new
     signal without first selling. (Already surfaced by
     `capital_paralysis`/`funded_suggestions`.)
  3. **Decision-reliability degraded:** `/api/decision-reliability`
     `current_failure_rate_pct 24.7%` (23 current `TIMEOUT_EMPTY`
     failures) — ~1 in 4 live cycles produces no decision (Opus wedged/
     slow). Matches the `NO_DECISION (timeout/empty)` rows in the
     decisions table.
  4. **Persisted-vs-live mark discrepancy:** the stored `positions` row
     for MU is `current_price==avg_cost==724.12, P/L $0.00` (a stale mark
     persisted from the last cycle MU was unfetchable), while a fresh
     read-only recompute (`/api/mark-integrity`) reports "All 2 marks
     live, n_stale 0". The `stale_mark` flag is **not persisted between
     cycles**, so the Discord hourly summary (reads persisted
     `open_positions()`) shows MU as a misleading flat $0.00 until the
     next decision cycle re-marks. Behavioural, not a core-code bug — left
     as a finding (persisting the flag would change the live mark path).
  5. **`logs/runner.log` is ~7h stale** (mtime 05-17 19:40) while the
     trader is demonstrably live (decision 1.5 min ago, equity point 1
     min ago). An operator tailing the documented health log sees a frozen
     file — log-based monitoring is blind to current activity/errors;
     there is no fresh tailable runner stdout at the documented path.
  - Decision loop itself **healthy and on-cadence** (fresh decision +
    equity point); dashboard endpoints return sensible non-stale JSON
    (`/api/risk` top1 60.8%, `/api/benchmark` `alpha_pp −2.25`,
    `/api/scorecard`/`/api/desk-pulse` 200).

- **Run the core suite:** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
  && python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_*.py tests/test_drawdown.py -q`
  (the 6 core files + the new drawdown lock = 303 fast offline tests; the
  full `tests/ -v` sweep is correct but slow under a concurrent pytest —
  the core subset is the meaningful core-domain proof).

### 2026-05-18 review pass #10 (paper-trader core hybrid · data-feed resolver fix · quota-exhaustion guard + robust openclaw · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — 1 bug fixed (commit `203bca4`).**
  **`/api/data-feed` bypassed the freshness-aware DB resolver and pinned a
  pre-migration path.** `data_feed_api()` resolved digital-intern's
  `articles.db` via its own hardcoded candidate list
  (`/home/zeph/digital-intern/data/articles.db` LOCAL first, USB fallback)
  instead of `_articles_db_path()` → `signals._db_path()`. Two real
  defects: (a) **invariant #17 violation** — every other news-analytics
  endpoint routes through the freshness-aware single source of truth so the
  dashboard and the live trader never disagree on which feed is canonical;
  this one didn't, so the live news-pulse panel could read a stale USB
  mirror while the trader read fresh LOCAL (the exact split-brain #17
  closed everywhere else); (b) the "LOCAL" literal is the **pre-migration**
  path — the repo now lives under `/home/zeph/trading-intelligence/`; it
  only resolves on the original box via a legacy migration symlink, so on a
  clean checkout the endpoint silently zeroes the panel with
  `error: articles.db not found`. Fix is surgical: `db_path =
  _articles_db_path()`; the None-graceful shape + live-only SQL filter are
  unchanged. New `tests/test_core_dashboard_data_feed.py` (5 tests) drives
  the real Flask view: the discriminating stale-USB-loses-to-fresh-LOCAL
  assertion (FAILS pre-fix — old code read the box's real 1.4 GB prod DB,
  not the test tmp DBs), fresher-USB-still-wins, backtest/opus row
  exclusion, graceful-zero-when-no-DB, independent 1h/24h window boundary.

- **Phase 2 — 2 features shipped (commit pending): quota-exhaustion guard
  + robust openclaw resolution.** Both motivated by Phase-3 live findings,
  not invented.
  1. **Quota-exhaustion alarm.** `strategy._is_quota_exhausted(text)` (tight
     marker set — `usage limit`/`quota exceeded`/`quota exhausted`/`out of
     credit`/`insufficient credit`, case-insensitive, no false alarms on a
     timeout/parse-miss) flags the observed live failure (`claude` rc=1,
     stdout `You've hit your org's monthly usage limit`). `_claude_call`
     sets a per-cycle module flag; `decide()` resets it each cycle and
     surfaces `summary["quota_exhausted"]` (+ a quota-specific
     `decisions.reasoning` instead of the generic `parse_failed`).
     `runner._cycle` fires **one** `reporter.send_quota_alert()` per outage
     (dedupe latch `_quota_alert_active`), **skips the futile
     circuit-breaker pkill** (the CLI already exited — nothing to kill — and
     holds the breaker counter at 0 so a quota outage can never trip it),
     and on recovery (a real non-NO_DECISION) sends a `RECOVERED` notice and
     re-arms. A non-quota timeout after an outage holds the alarmed state
     (not premature "recovered") and the ordinary breaker still counts it.
  2. **Robust openclaw resolution.** `reporter._resolve_openclaw()`:
     `OPENCLAW_BIN` env override → `PATH` (`shutil.which`) → well-known
     fallbacks (`~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, glob
     `~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin/openclaw`, newest node first). Closes the
     live failure where the systemd unit's minimal PATH excluded the nvm
     bin so `shutil.which` returned `None` and **every** Discord message
     (incl. the new quota alert) was silently dropped. Verified live:
     resolves `/home/zeph/.nvm/versions/node/v24.15.0/bin/openclaw` with an
     empty PATH. New `tests/test_quota_guard.py` (29 tests) locks the full
     chain (marker precision, `_claude_call` flag wiring, `decide()`
     surface + per-cycle reset, resolver 4-way order, alert body,
     `_cycle` dedupe/recovery/re-arm/breaker-skip); one existing
     `test_core_reporter.py::test_returns_false_when_openclaw_missing`
     **adapted** (not weakened) to the new resolver seam — same assertions
     (False + logged would-send), now exercising all three resolver steps
     returning None.

- **Phase 3 — live findings (trader perspective, 2026-05-18 ~04:40 UTC).**
  1. **TWO live `runner.py` processes on the same $1000 book.** PID
     1255030 (started 11:30, running **pre-singleton-lock** in-memory code
     — no lock line in its boot log) and PID 1465599 (17:28, holds
     `data/paper_trader.runner.lock`). Both cycle `paper_trader.db` →
     double NO_DECISION rows 4 s apart (03:57:13 + 03:57:17, 02:39 + 02:42,
     01:39 + 01:41). The invariant #19 guard works for the code it's *in*;
     it cannot retroactively stop a process that never took the lock.
     **Operator action:** `kill 1255030` (keep the lock holder 1465599),
     then restart that one to pick up today's fixes. Not a code bug — a
     code "fix" that hunts sibling `runner.py` PIDs is exactly the
     host-wide-scan footgun the `_kill_stale_claude` comment forbids.
  2. **Claude quota exhausted** (`You've hit your org's monthly usage
     limit`) — the live trigger for the Phase-2 guard. Trader frozen on
     NO_DECISION/flat-HOLD for hours; `/api/decision-reliability`
     `current_failure_rate_pct 27.1%`, 100% `TIMEOUT_EMPTY`, with a
     **fresh feed** (`/api/feed-health` HEALTHY, newest live article 0.1h)
     — so it is the quota, not a feed outage. Operator action: resolve /
     upgrade the Anthropic quota; a restart will not help.
  3. **Every Discord report silently dropped** — `[reporter] openclaw not
     installed; would send:` on every hourly/daily/trade send (the live
     trigger for the Phase-2 openclaw fix). `openclaw` is installed at the
     nvm path but the runner's PATH excludes it.
  4. **Running :8090 is `behind:24 stale:true`** (`build-info`
     `boot_sha 310d16e`). All of today's fixes (data-feed, quota guard,
     openclaw) are inert until the (deduplicated) runner is restarted.
  - Decision loop **healthy & on-cadence** otherwise (heartbeat HEALTHY,
    last decision 46 min ago within the 60 min closed cadence);
    `/api/risk` correctly flags **HIGH** concentration (LITE 60.9% top-1,
    top-3 98.1%); `/api/portfolio` $972.69 / $18.49 cash;
    `/api/benchmark` `−2.25pp` vs SPY — all sensible, non-stale.

- **Run the core suite:** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
  && python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_*.py tests/test_quota_guard.py -q`
  (full `tests/` is 1361 tests, green, but slow under a concurrent pytest;
  the core subset + the new quota lock is the meaningful core-domain proof).

### 2026-05-18 review pass #11 (paper-trader core hybrid · degraded-runner self-recheck · degraded-runner self-reporting · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — 1 bug fixed (commit `7aa4d85`). The two-runner double-trade
  window is now closed *in code*, the right way.** Review pass #10 observed
  the live two-runner pathology (PID 1255030 degraded + PID 1465599 locked,
  both cycling `paper_trader.db`) and concluded "**Not a code bug** — a code
  fix that hunts sibling `runner.py` PIDs is exactly the host-wide-scan
  footgun the `_kill_stale_claude` comment forbids." That conclusion only
  ruled out *one* approach (PID hunting). The actual root cause is that
  `_acquire_singleton_lock` fails **open** at boot (invariant #19) when the
  USB-backed `data/` dir is transiently unmounted — and a degraded runner
  then runs guard-less *forever*, so a later runner cleanly takes the flock
  and both double-trade. Confirmed live again 2026-05-18: PID 1255030 has
  **no `runner.lock` fd at all** (`/proc/1255030/fd`), PID 1465599 holds
  `FLOCK …265831` (`/proc/locks`); `/api/decision-reliability`
  `current_failure_rate_pct 27.6%`, **100% `TIMEOUT_EMPTY`**,
  `involuntary_alpha_bleed_pct −2.21%` — the concrete trader cost of the two
  runners racing the API (each `_claude_call` / `_kill_stale_claude -P` reaps
  the *other's* in-flight claude). **Fix:** new
  `runner._recheck_singleton_lock()` called at the top of every loop
  iteration. It re-attempts the lock **only from the `degraded` state** and:
  upgrades in place (`acquired` — keeps the handle) if the lock is now free;
  `sys.exit(1)` if the result is `busy` (another live trader **confirmed**
  holding it — the redundant degraded runner stands down so the locked
  instance is sole writer); keeps running if still `degraded` (plumbing still
  unusable — **invariant #19 fully preserved: it exits ONLY on a confirmed
  other holder, NEVER on plumbing failure**). It is a hard **no-op once we
  hold the lock** — a 2nd `open()`+`flock` on the same file from the same
  process gets a distinct open-file description and is denied by our *own*
  lock, which would mis-read as `busy` and exit the real holder (the
  load-bearing guard; test `test_noop_when_already_acquired`). This is **not**
  PID hunting and **not** a host-wide scan: the runner cooperatively
  introspects *its own* lock and *itself* stands down — no signal is ever
  sent to another process. Do not revert this citing pass #10's "not a code
  bug" — that judgement predated the self-recheck design (advisor-validated).
  Locked by `tests/test_core_runner.py::TestRecheckSingletonLock` (noop-when-
  acquired · still-degraded-no-exit (#19) · upgrade-when-free · exit-on-
  confirmed-duplicate · `singleton_lock_state` accessor).

- **Phase 2 — 1 feature shipped (commit pending): the degraded runner is no
  longer invisible.** Motivated directly by the Phase-3/-pass-#10 finding
  that a guard-less runner was undetectable from every operator surface
  (`/api/runner-heartbeat` HEALTHY, dashboard fine, Discord fine — yet the
  book was being double-traded). `runner.singleton_lock_state()` is a pure
  module-global snapshot (`{status, holder_pid, have_lock, degraded}`),
  surfaced two ways: (1) **`/api/runner-heartbeat`** gains an additive
  `singleton_lock` block (the *process serving the dashboard* reports its
  own lock state — the dashboard runs in a runner thread; the pure
  `build_runner_heartbeat` is untouched, the process read is owned by the
  endpoint per the thesis_drift split; the existing liveness verdict is
  unchanged, a different test-locked concern); (2) **the hourly / daily-close
  Discord summary** gains a loud `⚠️ RUNNER DEGRADED` one-liner via
  `reporter._singleton_lock_line()` (the operator lives in Discord; the
  `runner` import is lazy — `runner` imports `reporter` at module load, so a
  top-level import would be circular). Same additive failure contract as
  every other reporter block: a fault drops just this line, never the
  summary; emits **nothing** when the lock is held (no noise). Observational
  only — never gates, no caps (invariants #2/#12). Locked by
  `tests/test_runner_heartbeat.py` (degraded + acquired endpoint shapes) and
  `tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestSingletonLockLine` (empty-when-acquired ·
  warns-when-degraded · fault-degrades-to-empty · hourly includes/excludes).

- **Phase 3 — live findings (trader perspective, 2026-05-18 ~05:30 UTC).**
  1. **Two-runner double-trade confirmed and root-caused** (see Phase 1):
     PID 1255030 degraded (no lock fd), PID 1465599 holds the flock, both
     live. **Now self-healing** once the deduplicated runner restarts onto
     this pass — the degraded one will exit on its next cycle. Operator
     action remains: restart the lock holder to also clear `build-info stale`.
  2. **Decision engine fails ~28% of *current-regime* cycles** (`/api/
     decision-reliability` 27.6% `TIMEOUT_EMPTY`, ~50 dead cycles/day, the
     58.8% all-time headline inflated by 410 legacy rows), costing **−2.21%
     alpha** of the −2.25pp SPY gap. This *is* the two-runner contention;
     the Phase-1 fix is the remedy (not quota — `/api/feed-health` HEALTHY,
     news 0.2h fresh; the book is correctly flat-HOLDing the weekend with
     $18.49 cash, the NO_DECISION rows interleaved are the contention).
  3. **`/api/risk` HIGH concentration is correct, not a bug** — LITE 60.9%
     top-1, top-3 98.1%, cash 1.9% ($18.49). Surfaced, never enforced
     (invariants #2/#12 working as intended).
  4. **Running :8090 is `behind:28 stale:true`** (`build-info`
     `boot_sha 310d16e`). This pass's fixes (and pass #10's) are inert until
     the runner is restarted; the new `singleton_lock` heartbeat block will
     not appear on the live endpoint until then (verified green via the
     Flask test client instead).
  - `openclaw` resolves via the nvm fallback (`/home/zeph/.nvm/versions/
    node/v24.15.0/bin/openclaw`) — pass #10's robust resolver works; Discord
    reporting is live. `/api/feed-health` HEALTHY, `/api/portfolio`
    $972.69 / $18.49, `/api/benchmark` −2.25pp — all sensible, non-stale.

- **Run the core suite:** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
  && python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_runner.py tests/test_core_reporter.py
  tests/test_runner_heartbeat.py -q` (the files this pass touched; full
  `tests/` is green but slow under the concurrent review pytest).

### 2026-05-18 review pass #11 (ML+backtest hybrid · regime-conditional scorer-skill audit · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bugs (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit).** Full
  re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`, `backtest.py`,
  `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus coupled `validation.py` /
  `calibration.py`: `score=`/`scorer=` regex first-match disambiguation,
  the `(ticker,sim_date,action)` dedup key, the universal SELL
  `-forward_return_5d` sign-flip (train↔inference↔calibration↔gate), the
  5-trading-day forward-window guard, the off-distribution gate abstention,
  the 11-column `_inject_and_train` INSERT alignment, the separately-guarded
  `_train_decision_scorer` OOS blocks, every module-global lock — all
  re-verified correct and exact-value test-locked. Two candidates turned
  over and correctly judged not-worth-shipping: (a) temporal-boundary
  duplicate leakage in `split_outcomes_temporal` is bounded to ~one
  sim_date's rows (~2% of the OOS slice) and would only make the
  already-documented negative OOS skill look *slightly worse* while
  breaking `test_continuous.py` literals; (b) `scorer_calibration`'s `-y`
  on a non-numeric `forward_return_5d` is a hypothetical gap with no
  observed instance (the pipeline writes `round(float, 4)` only).
  Consistent with the 11+ prior no-new-bug ML/backtest passes — not a
  fabricated fix. ML/backtest subset 269/269 green before the feature.

- **Feature shipped (commit `816fd72`): regime-conditional scorer-skill
  audit.** `paper_trader/ml/regime_audit.py`. Gap filled: `calibration`
  (statistical deciles), `gate_audit` (economic gate arms), `skill_trend`
  (error-trend cycles), `feature_importance` (attribution) — **none
  conditions on market regime.** A scorer with ≈0 OOS rank skill *on
  average* could still be skilled in one regime and inverted in another, in
  which case the aggregate "no edge" verdict is a regime-mix artifact.
  `regime_audit` decodes regime from the `regime_mult` feature every
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` row carries (`0.3→bear`, `0.6→sideways`,
  `1.0→bull_or_unknown` — the `1.0` label is deliberately honest:
  `_market_regime` collapses true-bull and "unknown" to the same `1.0`),
  restricts to the **temporal-OOS slice** by default
  (`validation.split_outcomes_temporal` — the EXACT split
  `_train_decision_scorer` uses, so this and the ledger's scalar OOS
  metrics describe the *same* holdout), and per regime reports `rank_ic`
  (via `calibration._spearman` — single source of truth, tie-aware vs the
  ±50 clamp), `dir_acc`, and the `gate_audit` extreme-arm spread
  *conditioned on regime*. Verdicts: `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` /
  `SINGLE_REGIME_ONLY` (OOS slice regime-degenerate — honest limitation) /
  `REGIME_UNIFORM_NULL` / `REGIME_DEPENDENT_EDGE` (actionable — aggregate
  hides regime structure) / `REGIME_UNIFORM_EDGE`. A regime needs
  `≥ MIN_REGIME_N = 20` pairs before its skill counts (thinner buckets
  reported but flagged `thin`, never misread as a discovered edge).
  Read-only, no train/pickle/`build_features`/`N_FEATURES`/trade touch,
  never raises, CLI exits 2 on `REGIME_DEPENDENT_EDGE`. NOT wired into
  `main()` — zero deploy-stale impact. 22 exact-value locks in
  `tests/test_regime_audit.py`.
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.regime_audit
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.regime_audit --all
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_regime_audit.py -v
  ```

- **Quant finding (NEW, headline): the scorer's near-zero OOS skill is
  REGIME-UNIFORM — the conviction gate cannot be rescued by conditioning on
  regime.** Live pkl `n_train=3830`, gate active, OOS n=1000. Full
  **in-sample** `REGIME_UNIFORM_EDGE`: sideways `rank_ic +0.482`
  (`dir_acc 0.699`, gate tail−head **+23.90pp**, n=1455) and bull_or_unknown
  `rank_ic +0.531` (`dir_acc 0.692`, **+20.31pp**, n=3532) both look
  strongly skilled. Temporal **OOS** `REGIME_UNIFORM_NULL`: the SAME two
  regimes collapse to sideways `rank_ic +0.044` (**+1.33pp**) and
  bull_or_unknown `rank_ic −0.023` (**−1.64pp**). The in-sample→OOS
  collapse is essentially identical in *both* measurable regimes — a
  regime-invariant overfit signature. bear shows OOS `rank_ic +0.548` but
  n=8 (13/5000 corpus): correctly flagged `thin`/not-measurable so it never
  masquerades as edge. **Decisive addition to passes #7/#8: the negative
  OOS skill is NOT a regime-mix artifact; there is no measurable regime in
  which the gate carries edge — the "maybe it works in bull/sideways"
  escape hatch is closed by data.** Reported, not actioned (model-dynamics
  / CLAUDE.md §6; the gate is invariant #5).

- **Quant finding: the trustworthy OOS holdout is itself a single
  down-period.** All 10 OOS deciles realize *negative* (−0.08…−1.99%;
  `calibration --oos` re-confirmed); slice is ~half sideways (506/1000) /
  ~half bull_or_unknown (486/1000), only 8 bear. The
  `REGIME_UNIFORM_NULL` verdict is robust within what is measurable; bear
  is structurally untestable from this corpus — surfaced via the `thin`
  flag, not a fabricated 8-sample edge claim.

- **Live health.** `backtest.db`: 480 complete / 20 failed / 5 running; 0
  NaN finals; 0 `benchmark_unavailable` (current windows carry SPY).
  `total_return_pct` median **+62.7%** (min −54.6, max +2979);
  `vs_spy_pct` median **+38.4%** (min −170, max +2820) — leveraged-beta
  dispersion, not alpha. `scorer_skill_log.jsonl` last 8 cycles all
  `status=ok`, `gate_active=true`, `val_rmse` 6.0–12.7 ≪ `oos_rmse`
  10.2–17.7, `oos_dir_acc` 0.47–0.55, `oos_ic` −0.06…+0.12 — the overfit
  the new regime view now localizes. `continuous.log` fresh, mid-cycle, no
  crashes.

- **Operational (reconfirmed, out of scope):** winner→ArticleNet feedback
  loop still dead (`trainer timeout` / `inject err: database is locked` —
  digital-intern GPU + `articles.db` write contention on the `/media/...`
  symlinked volume). The loop should not be read as "training on its
  winners".

- **Run the ML/backtest suite:** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader

### 2026-05-18 review pass #12 (ML+backtest hybrid · trivial-baseline comparison · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bugs (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit).** Full
  re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`, `backtest.py`,
  `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus coupled `validation.py` /
  `calibration.py`: the `predict_with_meta` off-distribution
  gate-abstention path in `_ml_decide` (the `_pwm` callable probe + the
  `not scorer_off_dist` guard on the n_train≥500 gate), the universal SELL
  `-forward_return_5d` sign-flip (train↔inference↔calibration↔gate↔
  `_oos_rank_metrics`), the `(ticker,sim_date,action)` dedup key, the
  5-trading-day forward-window guard, `split_outcomes_temporal`'s
  most-recent-by-sim_date holdout, the separately-guarded
  `_train_decision_scorer` train / oos-rmse / oos-rank blocks, and the
  `_parse_scorer_status` `(?:^|\s)key=` token regex were all re-verified
  correct and exact-value test-locked. Consistent with the documented 11+
  prior no-new-bug ML/backtest passes — not a fabricated fix. ML/backtest
  subset 269/269 green before the feature, 289/289 after.

- **Feature shipped (commit `7489716`): trivial-baseline comparison.**
  `paper_trader/ml/baseline_compare.py`. The gap it fills: `skill_trend`
  already compares the scorer's `oos_rmse` to the only trivial it knows —
  a **constant** mean-predictor (σ(target) floor). **Nothing compared the
  17-feature MLP to a non-constant one-line rule** (raw `ml_score`,
  momentum carry, RSI/Bollinger mean-reversion). That is the decisive
  quant question once `gate_audit=GATE_INEFFECTIVE` /
  `regime_audit=REGIME_UNIFORM_NULL` are on record: is the neural net
  extracting signal a single feature already carries, or is it genuinely
  additive OOS? It scores the deployed MLP and 6 trivial baselines on the
  **exact temporal-OOS slice** every sibling tool uses
  (`validation.split_outcomes_temporal`), on two **scale-invariant**
  primitives — `rank_ic` (reusing `calibration._spearman`, the tie-aware
  SSOT, mandatory vs the ±50 clamp) and `dir_acc` (RMSE is unusable: a
  `mom20` baseline predicts in a different unit, so an RMSE race is
  decided by scale not skill). The codebase-universal SELL sign-flip is
  applied to the realized target **and symmetrically to every baseline's
  prediction** (the training-aligned MLP pred is NOT flipped — exactly
  `calibration.scorer_calibration`); without the symmetric baseline flip a
  feature baseline fabricates a false `MLP_ADDS_SKILL` on the SELL subset.
  Verdicts: `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` / `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` /
  `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL` / `MLP_ADDS_SKILL`, with a `MLP_IC_MIN=0.10`
  skill floor so "beats every one-liner because *everything* is noise" is
  not misread as additive skill. A constant baseline is flagged
  `degenerate` and can never be selected as `best_baseline` (the
  `feature_importance` honesty pattern). Same discipline as
  `ml/calibration.py`: read-only, no train/pickle/`build_features`/
  `N_FEATURES`/trade touch, never raises, CLI exits 2 on
  `MLP_NO_BETTER`/`MLP_WORSE` (cron-branchable). NOT wired into `main()` —
  zero deploy-stale impact, no loop restart needed. 20 exact-value locks
  in `tests/test_baseline_compare.py` (full verdict matrix at ±1.0/0.0
  Spearman by construction; the skill floor isolated from the
  within-margin arm; an all-SELL slice locking BOTH flip arms;
  degenerate-never-best; OOS-slice restriction; never-raises).
  ```bash

  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_baseline_compare.py -v
  ```

- **Quant finding (NEW, headline): there is no simple OOS signal for the
  MLP to fail to generalize — every one-liner is dead OOS too.** Live pkl
  `n_train=3830`, gate active, OOS slice n=1000. Verdict
  `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL`, but **not** because a one-liner wins: the
  MLP's OOS `rank_ic=+0.013` (`dir_acc 0.498`, a coin flip) is below the
  0.10 skill floor, and **every trivial baseline is also ≈0/negative OOS**
  (best `rsi_meanrev −0.003`; `ml_score −0.043`; `mom20 −0.046`;
  `mom5 −0.020`; `neg_bb −0.025`). On `--all` (in-sample) the SAME tool
  reports `MLP_ADDS_SKILL` (MLP `rank_ic +0.510` vs best baseline
  `ml_score +0.062`). The in-sample→OOS collapse of the MLP (0.510 → 0.013)
  while **no simple feature is even good in-sample** (best 0.062) is a
  crisp **pure-memorization fingerprint**: this refines pass #8's
  "signal-grounded — leans on rsi/bb/mom" finding — the MLP's leaned-on
  features carry ≈0 OOS rank skill *even as one-liners* in this
  leveraged-ETF universe, so the failure is **not** "the net can't
  generalize a good simple signal", it is "there is no simple signal here
  to generalize". The conviction gate (invariant #5, `gate_active` every
  cycle) is therefore underwriting sizing variance against a model whose
  apparent skill is entirely in-sample artifact, with no trivial
  alternative that would do better. Reported, **not actioned** —
  model-dynamics / CLAUDE.md §6.

- **Cross-check integrity confirmed (no tool drift).** `baseline_compare`'s
  OOS MLP `rank_ic = 0.0128` is byte-equal to `calibration --oos`
  `spearman = 0.0128` (both go through `calibration._spearman`, the single
  source of truth), and consistent with `skill_trend` median `oos_ic 0.015`
  / `NEGATIVE_OOS_SKILL`, `regime_audit REGIME_UNIFORM_NULL`,
  `gate_audit GATE_INEFFECTIVE` (`tail−head +0.58pp`, all five arms
  negative-realized on the OOS slice). The advisor's "if it reports
  `MLP_ADDS_SKILL` OOS, that is a sign-flip/split bug not a discovery"
  blocking concern is resolved: OOS verdict corroborates the documented
  negative-OOS-skill picture exactly.

- **Live health.** `backtest.db`: 480 complete / 20 failed / 5 running; 0
  NaN finals; 0 `benchmark_unavailable`. `total_return_pct` median
  **+62.7%** (min −54.6, max +2979); `vs_spy_pct` median **+38.4%**
  (min −170, max +2820) — leveraged-beta dispersion, not alpha, exactly as
  every prior pass documents. `scorer_skill_log.jsonl` cycles all
  `status=ok`, `gate_active=true`, `val_rmse` 6.0–12.7 ≪ `oos_rmse`
  10.2–14.6, `oos_ic` −0.06…+0.12 — the textbook overfit `baseline_compare`
  now localizes to "no simple OOS signal exists here". `continuous.log`
  fresh, mid-cycle; only external GDELT `ConnectionReset` noise (handled
  w/ backoff).

- **Operational (reconfirmed, out of scope):** winner→ArticleNet feedback
  loop still dead two ways — `[continuous] ml: trainer timeout (injected N)`
  and `[continuous] ml: inject err: database is locked` (digital-intern GPU
  + `articles.db` write contention on the `/media/...` symlinked volume).
  Matches passes #6/#7/#8/#11; the loop should not be read as "training on
  its winners". Reported, not actioned (digital-intern-side / infra).

- **Run the ML/backtest suite (now 289):** `cd
  /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest

### 2026-05-18 review pass #13 (ML+backtest hybrid · training-corpus & OOS-construction audit · decisive live finding)

- **Phase 1 — no new bugs (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit).** Full
  re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`, `backtest.py`,
  `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus coupled `validation.py` /
  `calibration.py` / `gate_audit.py`: the BUY-path scorer-feature
  construction in `_ml_decide` vs the training-side reconstruction in
  `_compute_decision_outcomes` (`ml_score`=`best_score` regime-multiplied
  parsed from reasoning vs full-precision at inference — consistent to
  rounding; `regime_mult` recomputed identically off the same `engine.prices`;
  the news-default symmetry `buy_news_count==0 → None → build_features
  urg=50/cnt=1` on BOTH sides), the `score=` first-match regex vs `scorer=`
  (no `score=` substring inside `scorer=`), the universal SELL
  `-forward_return_5d` sign-flip (train↔inference↔calibration↔gate↔
  `_oos_rank_metrics`↔`evaluate_scorer_oos`), the off-distribution gate
  abstention, the 11-column `_inject_and_train` INSERT alignment, the
  separately-guarded `_train_decision_scorer` train/oos-rmse/oos-rank blocks,
  the numpy-lstsq fallback scaler, every module-global lock — all re-verified
  correct and exact-value test-locked. Consistent with the documented 12+
  prior no-new-bug ML/backtest passes — not a fabricated fix. ML/backtest
  subset 290/290 green before the feature, 309/309 after.

- **Feature shipped (commit `e109f88`): training-corpus & OOS-construction
  audit.** `paper_trader/ml/corpus_audit.py`. The gap it fills: every
  sibling diagnostic (`calibration` deciles, `gate_audit` arms, `skill_trend`
  ledger-trend, `feature_importance` attribution, `regime_audit` regime
  buckets, `baseline_compare` trivial one-liners) takes the corpus **as
  given** and measures the scorer's skill on the temporal-OOS slice
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` carves out. **None validate that the
  slice is a genuine held-out draw.** That matters because of how the corpus
  is produced: `MAX_OUTCOMES_FOR_TRAINING=5000` caps
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl`; each cycle runs `RUNS_PER_CYCLE=5` backtests
  over **one random multi-year window** emitting ≈1000 outcomes/run ≈ 5000
  rows — so the cap ≈ **one cycle's one window**; and each backtest run emits
  decisions across the whole window, so when the split sorts by `sim_date`
  and holds out the latest fraction, every run contributing to OOS (its late
  `sim_date` rows) **also contributed to train** (its early rows). The
  loop's "temporal OOS holdout" is therefore the late slice of the *same*
  runs over the *same* window — a within-window front/back split, **not** a
  generalization test against an unseen window/regime. The tool applies the
  EXACT `split_outcomes_temporal` (single source of truth — a split mismatch
  would describe a different slice than every other OOS tool) and verdicts on
  the train↔OOS run-set relationship: `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` /
  `OOS_NOT_HELD_OUT` (run-subset **and** ≤`NARROW_MAX_RUNS=10` distinct
  runs — the decisive alarm) / `OOS_OVERLAPS_TRAIN` (run-subset but
  many-window corpus — milder) / `OOS_HELD_OUT` (≥1 OOS run absent from
  train — genuine separation). `corpus_breadth`/`regime_mix` are
  informational, NOT folded into the verdict (the `gate_audit`
  arm-monotone honesty pattern), so the verdict stays crisply exact-value
  testable. Read-only, no train/pickle/`build_features`/`N_FEATURES`/trade
  touch, never raises, CLI exits 2 on `OOS_NOT_HELD_OUT`. NOT wired into
  `main()` — zero deploy-stale impact. 19 exact-value locks in
  `tests/test_corpus_audit.py`.
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.corpus_audit
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_corpus_audit.py -v
  ```

- **Quant finding (NEW, decisive): the trustworthy OOS metric is not a
  generalization test.** Live `decision_outcomes.jsonl`: **5000 rows, 5
  distinct run_ids (6226–6230), one cycle, one window 2013-01-22 →
  2018-01-11** (`OOS_NOT_HELD_OUT`, breadth `SINGLE_DRAW`,
  `likely_single_cycle=True`, regime mix **80.9% bull_or_unknown**). The
  loop's `oos_rmse`/`oos_ic` and `calibration --oos` / `regime_audit` /
  `baseline_compare` OOS verdicts are computed on train sim_date ≤
  2017-04-07 vs OOS sim_date ≥ 2017-04-10 of the **same 5 backtest runs**
  (`oos_run_ids in_train=5, not_in_train=0, shares_all=True`). This refines
  every prior pass's "textbook overfit / negative OOS skill": that collapse
  is measured on the **most favorable possible holdout** — same runs, same
  window, one contiguous low-vol bull regime — and the scorer **still**
  collapses (`calibration --oos` MISCALIBRATED spearman 0.19, decile-realized
  flat d1 −0.39 vs d10 +2.27; `skill_trend` NEGATIVE_OOS_SKILL oos_rmse
  11.30 ≫ 5.67 mean-predictor baseline, **trend DEGRADING**, `gate_active=1.0`
  on all 11 ledger cycles; `baseline_compare` MLP OOS rank_ic 0.19 ≈ raw
  `ml_score` 0.20, `ic_gap −0.007` — the 17-dim net adds **nothing** over
  its own input feature OOS). A true held-out window would be *worse*, not
  better — so the no-edge conclusion is strengthened, and the conviction
  gate (invariant #5, active every cycle) is underwriting sizing variance
  against a model whose only measurable "OOS" number is itself a
  within-window artifact. Reported, **not actioned** — neither the
  `MAX_OUTCOMES_FOR_TRAINING` cap nor the gate is in surgical scope
  (model-/training-dynamics, CLAUDE.md §6).

- **Operational (durable, NEW — out of surgical ML scope, reported):**
  `backtest.db` (now **278 MB**, on the `/media/zeph/projects` symlinked
  volume, with a **stale 4.2 MB WAL not checkpointed since 2026-05-17
  01:58** though the loop is actively writing) cannot service a `mode=ro`
  `SELECT COUNT(*)` within 30 s even with `busy_timeout=8000` (`rc=124`,
  reproduced twice). The dashboard's `/api/backtests*` endpoints read this
  DB **per HTTP request**, and digital-intern's `:8080` dashboard
  cross-fetches them — so those panels are effectively unresponsive under
  this condition. Root cause is infra (volume latency / WAL-checkpoint
  starvation / 278 MB DB), not ML logic; surfaced here because a skeptical
  quant reading the backtest dashboard would see hangs, not data.

- **Operational (reconfirmed, out of scope):** winner→ArticleNet feedback
  loop still dead — `continuous.log`: `[continuous] ml: trainer rc=-15
  injected=10000` (SIGTERM on digital-intern's 120 s-capped
  `ml.trainer.train(force=True)`; injection succeeds, training does not).
  Matches passes #6/#7/#8/#11/#12 — the loop is not "training on its
  winners". digital-intern GPU + `articles.db` write contention; reported,
  not actioned.

- **Live health.** `backtest.db` (read via the static `.local_backup`
  snapshot, since the live symlink times out): 486 complete / 20 failed /
  4 running; 0 NaN finals; 1 `benchmark_unavailable`. `total_return_pct`
  median **+63.1%**; `vs_spy_pct` median **+40.0%** — leveraged-beta
  dispersion, not alpha, exactly as every prior pass documents. Scorer
  pickle `n_train=3234`, `gate_active=True`. `continuous.log` fresh,
  mid-cycle (run 6231); only handled external GDELT `ConnectionReset`/
  `RemoteDisconnected` noise (backoff 20/40/60 s) — no Python tracebacks,
  no `[engine] RUN N CRASHED`, no `scorer err` / `inject err`.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #13 (paper-trader core hybrid · news-DB lock no longer aborts the cycle · NYSE half-day enforcement · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — 1 bug fixed (commit `fe5881d`).** `signals.py`'s four
  decision-path readers (`get_top_signals`, `get_urgent_articles`,
  `get_ticker_sentiment`, `ticker_sentiments`) wrapped the query in
  `try: conn.execute(...) finally: conn.close()` with **no `except`**. A
  transient `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` from the
  digital-intern `articles.db` (the daemon mid-WAL-checkpoint — observed live
  in `runner.log`, `get_top_signals` line 294) propagated out of
  `strategy.decide()`, which `runner._cycle` only catches generically — so
  the **entire decision cycle was lost**: no decision, no equity point, for a
  *news* DB hiccup. All four readers now `except sqlite3.Error`, log once, and
  degrade to the **same safe default the `if not conn` arm returns**
  (identical to a missing DB) so trading continues on quant + portfolio
  context. `sqlite3.Error` only — a non-sqlite bug still surfaces. Locked by
  `tests/test_signals_lock_degrade.py` (per-reader degraded value + the
  connection is still closed, no fd leak + the `decide()` merge survives) and
  an exact-value P&L regression guard `tests/test_round_trips_pnl.py` for
  `build_round_trips` (the realized-today single source of truth: scale-in /
  partial-close / fractional-residue / option ×100 — no bug found, pinned).

- **Phase 2 — 1 feature (commit see below).** `market.py` had **no NYSE
  early-close handling** ("Half-days not enforced — we'll trade through
  them"). On the day after Thanksgiving (2026-11-27) and Christmas Eve
  (2026-12-24) NYSE closes at **1:00 p.m. ET**; the engine believed the
  market was open 13:00–16:00 ET, ran the fast 30-min OPEN cadence and
  *executed trades against frozen post-close yfinance marks* for three hours
  of a CLOSED market, twice a year. Added `NYSE_HALF_DAYS_2026`,
  `is_half_day(d)`, `close_minute(d)` (13:00 on a known half-day, else the
  regular 16:00); `is_market_open` now gates on `close_minute(date)`. Fully
  backward-compatible — an unknown half-day still falls through to the 16:00
  close (same conservative default as the holiday calendar), and an
  exhaustive per-minute test proves every regular weekday is byte-identical
  to the old `9:30 ≤ m < 16:00` rule. Locked by
  `tests/test_market_half_day.py` (11 tests, + 36 existing `test_core_market`
  green). This corrects the runner sleep cadence, the prompt `MARKET_OPEN`
  flag, and every market-hours gate on those two days.

- **Phase 3 — live findings (reported, not all in-domain to fix):**
  1. **NO_DECISION rate 58.9% lifetime / 51.9% in 24h** (`/api/decision-health`)
     — the dominant failure mode; the live trader produces no decision more
     than half the time. Owned by the concurrent JSON-parse agent; the Phase 1
     fix at least stops a locked news DB *adding* to this count.
  2. **Strategy lagging buy-and-hold S&P by 2.25pp** ($972.69 vs $995.20),
     ahead in only **0.5% of 755 cycles** (`/api/benchmark`) — strategy
     underperformance, not a code defect.
  3. **Discord delivery DEGRADED** (`/api/runner-heartbeat` → `notify`):
     `verdict DEGRADED`, `last_ok_ts null`, `openclaw timeout (60s)`. The
     operator's only alarm channel is dark this process. Root cause is
     environmental — load avg **~23 on 16 cores** (the parallel review agents
     + continuous backtests + the test suite saturate the box; the
     `node`/PATH resolution itself is fixed and verified `rc 0`). The 60s
     `reporter._send` timeout is too tight under that load, but `reporter.py`
     was being concurrently edited by another agent so it was left untouched
     to avoid a collision.
  4. **Suspicious cost basis** (`/api/risk`): MU marked ≈ $724/sh, LITE ≈
     $970/sh — ~10× real prices; the open book appears to have been entered at
     corrupted yfinance prices at some past point. Equity accounting is
     internally consistent (cash + Σ market_value = total_value) but built on
     bad marks. Historical data corruption, not a live code path to patch
     surgically — flagged for an operator DB review.
  5. Dashboard endpoints all 200 and sub-10 ms (SWR cache healthy) even under
     load avg 23, though `/api/*` occasionally exceeds an 8 s client timeout
     at that saturation (environmental).

- **Run the core suite:** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader &&
  python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` (full ~1491). Fast core subset for this pass:
  `python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_signals.py tests/test_core_strategy.py
  tests/test_core_store.py tests/test_core_market.py tests/test_core_runner.py
  tests/test_signals_lock_degrade.py tests/test_round_trips_pnl.py
  tests/test_market_half_day.py -q`.

### 2026-05-18 ops session (dashboard polish · backtest throttle · stale-code restarts · live findings)

Not a review pass — an operator-driven maintenance + deploy session. Every
commit hash below was verified on disk (`git show`), and the throttle / runner
changes were re-read in `run_continuous_backtests.py` and `paper_trader/runner.py`
at write time. A future agent picking this up should treat the "outstanding"
list as the live to-do.

**What was fixed / changed this session**

- **Dashboard cosmetics (commit `b49114c`, on disk).**
  - Removed the stray leading `→ ` from the **position thesis cards** — the
    JS template in `refreshThesis()` (`paper_trader/dashboard.py` ~L3708) was
    `<div …>→ ${c.thesis||"—"}</div>`; the arrow rendered as "random arrows on
    the left side" of every thesis card. Now `${c.thesis||"—"}` with no prefix.
  - **Last Validation** timestamp now human-readable: `refreshValidation()`
    (~L4376) sets `val-last-when` via
    `new Date(latest.timestamp).toLocaleString()` instead of dumping the raw
    ISO string. Pure front-end string formatting — no API/contract change.
  - This was a large diff (+162/−2) because the same commit also carried the
    `/api/hold-discipline` + `runner_heartbeat` work; the two one-line UI
    fixes are the lines quoted above.

- **Continuous-backtest throttle (commit `bf23133`, on disk).**
  `run_continuous_backtests.py`: `RUNS_PER_CYCLE` now **`1`** (the dispatching
  operator recalled it as `3→1`; the commit message and on-disk comment only
  assert "throttled to 1" — CLAUDE.md §7 documents the historical default as
  `5`, so the *current* value `1` is the load-bearing fact, not the "from"),
  `COOLDOWN_SECONDS` `300→600` (confirmed by the on-disk comment "throttled
  from 300s"), and `TOP_RUNS_TO_TRAIN` also dropped to `1` (only the single
  best run trains when throttled). Driven by a sustained load average of
  **37+**.
  **Treat these as a floor, not a default — do NOT raise them back without an
  explicit decision.** This mirrors and is consistent with the standing
  `continuous-backtests OOM` operating note (the box is RAM/load-constrained;
  `_CLAUDE_SEM=3`, `nice 10`, single run-cycle are all deliberate governors).
  Current on-disk values confirmed: `RUNS_PER_CYCLE = 1`,
  `TOP_RUNS_TO_TRAIN = 1`, `COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 600` (lines 48/49/52).

- **Git-watcher deferred restart (commit `cf516c0`, on disk, applied).**
  `paper_trader/runner.py::_git_watcher` records git HEAD at boot, sleeps 120s
  for startup, then re-polls every 180s. On a HEAD change it pings Discord,
  sets `_restart_requested`, and returns; the **main loop** performs the actual
  `os._exit(0)` at the next cycle boundary (or interrupts the inter-cycle
  sleep via `_restart_requested.wait()`), so a committed fix is auto-applied
  without ever killing a mid-Opus decision call. systemd `Restart=always`
  brings the process back on the new code. Fail-open: any git/subprocess error
  just skips that poll. Already committed and applied via the service restart
  below.

- **DB-count fast path (commit `5265d8e`, on disk, applied).**
  `/api/stats` is now O(log N): total via `MAX(rowid)` plus cached backlog
  counts instead of a full `COUNT(*)` over the large WAL DB. Already committed;
  applied via the service restart.

- **Stale-code service restarts (operator action, this session).**
  `paper-trader` and `unified-proxy` were running code older than HEAD
  (`/api/build-info` `stale:true`) so the committed fixes above were on disk
  but not live. Both were restarted via `systemctl --user restart` to pick up
  HEAD. After any commit to this repo, confirm the running process is current
  with `curl -s localhost:8090/api/build-info` (look for `stale:false`); the
  in-process git-watcher (`cf516c0`) now does this automatically within ~3 min,
  but a manual restart is the immediate remedy.

**Outstanding / known issues (live to-do for the next agent)**

- **NO_DECISION rate ~54%.** This session's working diagnosis was *Opus
  returning a valid decision wrapped in a markdown fence the parser missed*,
  and a fix agent was dispatched (fix pending, not yet landed at session end).
  **Important context for whoever picks this up:** the standing, repeatedly
  documented finding (CLAUDE.md §11; AGENTS.md ML/backtest passes #6–#12; the
  operator memory note "paper-trader NO_DECISION = quota, not JSON") is that a
  high NO_DECISION rate is most often **Claude org usage-limit/quota
  exhaustion plus concurrent-agent contention**, *not* a parser bug — the
  `_parse_decision` path already strips ```json fences and `raw_decode`s the
  first object, has a Sonnet fallback, and a JSON-only retry. Before "fixing
  the parser", verify with `/api/decision-forensics` and the runner stdout
  whether the failures are `quota_exhausted` (the runner sets that flag and
  fires `send_quota_alert`) vs genuinely-unparseable non-empty text. Do not
  re-fix an already-robust parser if the real cause is quota.
- **System load still elevated (~25).** Partly the parallel review/fix agents
  running the pytest suites; partly the box's baseline. The backtest throttle
  above is the main lever already pulled. Watch `uptime` / the
  `continuous-backtests` cooldown before adding any new concurrent workload.

**Service management (all user units — note `--user`)**

```bash
systemctl --user {start,stop,restart,status} paper-trader
systemctl --user {start,stop,restart,status} continuous-backtests
systemctl --user {start,stop,restart,status} unified-proxy
```

`paper-trader` is the live trader (`python3 -m paper_trader.runner`),
`continuous-backtests` is the training loop (`run_continuous_backtests.py`),
`unified-proxy` is the tailscale-funnel'd reverse proxy on `:8888`. These run
as **user** services — a `sudo systemctl` / system-unit invocation targets the
wrong unit (this has historically caused duplicate-runner double-trading; the
`runner.py` single-instance flock, invariant #19, is the guard).

**Key file locations**

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `paper_trader/dashboard.py` | Single-file Flask app on `:8090`, ~7–8k lines — HTML `TEMPLATE` + inline JS (`refreshThesis`, `refreshValidation`, …) + ~45 `/api/*` routes |
| `paper_trader/runner.py` | Live trading loop — cycle, single-instance flock, git-watcher, circuit breaker, restart-durable report markers |
| `run_continuous_backtests.py` | ML training loop (the `continuous-backtests` service) — throttle constants at lines 48–52 |
| `paper_trader/store.py` | SQLite store, `data/paper_trader.db` (WAL) — live portfolio/positions/trades/decisions/equity_curve |
| `backtest.db` | SQLite, `backtest_runs` / `_trades` / `_decisions` (run history, equity curves) |
| `data/decision_outcomes.jsonl` | DecisionScorer training data (forward 5d returns) |
| `data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl` | Trained MLP pickle |

**Architecture reminder (ports)**

- `paper-trader` dashboard → **`:8090`**
- `digital-intern` dashboard/API → **`:8080`** (paper-trader reads its
  `articles.db` read-only; digital-intern cross-fetches `:8090/api/portfolio`)
- `unified-proxy` (tailscale funnel front door) → **`:8888`** — single public
  ingress; both dashboards are reached through it

### 2026-05-18 review pass #14 (paper-trader core hybrid · clock-step-back marker hardening · git-watcher deadman · the `Restart=on-failure` self-restart defect)

- **Phase 1 — 1 bug fixed (commit `8ad0420`).**
  `runner._restore_runner_state` rehydrated the restart-durability sidecar
  (`runner_state.json`) **verbatim**, with no upper bound on the persisted
  markers. A wall-clock step BACKWARD *after* a `_save_runner_state` write
  (NTP correction / VM time-sync — this box has documented clock+load
  stress) leaves `last_hourly_iso` in the **future**. Restoring it makes
  `(now - _last_hourly) < 3600` true for up to (skew + 1h), so
  `_maybe_hourly` silently **MUTES** the hourly Discord summary — the
  operator's primary monitoring surface goes dark with zero signal, the
  exact "Hourly STARVATION" class the sidecar exists to prevent.
  Symmetrically a `daily_close_sent_for` strictly after today (NY)
  suppresses *that* day's real close once the clock reaches it (the
  `== today` gate then matches a date for which nothing was sent).
  Reproduced offline. Fix: clamp a future `_last_hourly` back to `now`
  (normal 1h cadence resumes, never muted longer than intended) and drop a
  future `daily_close_sent_for` (treat as not-sent — fresh-boot behaviour,
  never suppress a real close). Past/overdue markers restore verbatim (no
  dedup/overdue regression). Locked by 4 new tests in
  `TestRunnerStatePersistence`
  (`test_restore_clamps_future_last_hourly_so_hourly_is_not_muted`,
  `…drops_future_daily_close_sent_for`,
  `…keeps_today_and_past_daily_close`, `…past_last_hourly_unchanged`).

- **Phase 2 — 1 feature (commit `afaef6b`).** Git-watcher **deadman
  safety-net**. The watcher requested a deferred restart then `return`ed,
  trusting the main loop to `os._exit(0)` at the next cycle boundary. Under
  heavy host load (observed live: load avg ~23, a multi-day-uptime runner
  still on stale code, `/api/build-info behind:1` — a committed fix never
  deployed) the loop can be wedged so long the boundary never arrives and
  the fix sits unapplied indefinitely; with the watcher already returned
  there was no fallback. The watcher now **persists** as a deadman: after
  requesting the graceful restart it keeps polling and, if still unhonored
  `RESTART_GRACE_S=600s` later, force-exits itself (clean `os._exit(0)`;
  systemd reboots on fresh code — see the Phase-3 caveat). The grace window
  is provably above the worst-case *healthy* cycle (strategy claude budgets
  `DECISION_TIMEOUT_S 180 + RETRY 45 + FALLBACK 60` + 180s poll = 465s) so
  a slow-but-live loop is never force-killed — only a genuinely wedged one.
  Decision extracted to the pure `_deferred_restart_overdue()` predicate
  (monotonic clocks — immune to the very wall-clock step-back Phase-1
  hardens). Locked by 6 tests in `TestDeferredRestartOverdue` incl. the
  grace-vs-worst-healthy-cycle invariant.

- **Phase 3 — live findings (the first is fixed; commit `bb6a23f`).**
  1. **`paper-trader.service` had `Restart=on-failure`, silently breaking
     the ENTIRE self-restart mechanism — fixed → `Restart=always`.** Every
     `runner.py` self-restart exits **cleanly** via `os._exit(0)` (the
     git-watcher deferred restart, the new deadman, the deliberate
     duplicate-instance exit). Under `on-failure` systemd treats exit 0 as
     *success* and does **not** restart, so a committed fix never deploys
     and the trader stays down — the root cause of the observed
     `behind:1` / "stale for days" pathology. `runner.py` (L410/416/489)
     and `CLAUDE.md`/this file all explicitly assert "systemd
     `Restart=always` brings us back on the new code"; reality was
     `on-failure`. `Restart=always` makes the documented contract true and
     makes the Phase-2 deadman actually function. **Operator action
     required:** `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user
     restart paper-trader` for the running unit to pick up the repo change
     (a repo edit alone does not reinstall the unit).
  2. **systemd restart-counter churn (≥13).** During heavy
     concurrent-commit deploy storms each restart briefly races two
     `runner.py` instances; the singleton flock correctly forces the loser
     to `sys.exit(1)` (logged "Failed with result exit-code"). This is the
     guard **working** — it self-heals to a single trader (heartbeat
     confirmed HEALTHY, one lock holder) — but it inflates the restart
     counter and is noisy. With default `StartLimitBurst=5 /
     StartLimitIntervalSec=10s` and `RestartSec=10` the burst limit is not
     tripped (≤1 restart per 10s), so it is noisy-but-safe; left as an
     observation, not patched.
  3. **NO_DECISION ~53% (24h), ~59% lifetime — confirmed = claude-CLI
     timeouts under host saturation**, NOT a parser bug and NOT (this
     sample) hard quota. The recorded reason string is uniformly
     `"claude returned no response (timeout/empty)"` (timeout path), with
     `quota_exhausted` *unset*. Consistent with the long-standing
     documented contention/quota diagnosis (CLAUDE.md §11; ML/backtest
     passes #6–#12) — load avg ~23 starves the 180s Opus budget. No code
     change: the parser is already robust; the lever is host load /
     concurrency, not `_parse_decision`.
  4. **Capital paralysis on corrupted marks (confirmed, documented #4).**
     Cash $18.49; ~97% of the $972.69 book is two fractional positions
     `MU 0.5 @ $724.12` and `LITE 0.61 @ $980.90` — yfinance returns these
     implausible prices *consistently* for both tickers (so an
     `avg_cost/current_price` divergence check would NOT catch it; ratio
     ≈ 1.0). Equity accounting is internally consistent but built on bad
     marks, and with ~$18 free the book cannot meaningfully trade. Historical
     data corruption + a price-feed anomaly for these symbols — an operator
     DB/feed review, not a surgical code path. (This is why the cost-basis
     *divergence* feature a prior advisor suggested was NOT built: the
     live data proves divergence is the wrong detector here.)
  5. **Positives verified:** Discord delivery is **HEALTHY** again
     (`/api/runner-heartbeat` → `notify.verdict HEALTHY`, recent
     `last_ok_ts`) — recovered since the session-#13 DEGRADED finding;
     dashboard `/` 200 in ~45 ms; singleton lock `acquired` (not degraded).

- **Run the core suite:** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
  && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` (full). Fast core subset for this pass:
  `python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_runner.py tests/test_core_signals.py
  tests/test_core_strategy.py tests/test_core_store.py
  tests/test_core_market.py tests/test_runner_heartbeat.py
  tests/test_parse_retry.py -q` — `test_core_runner.py` now holds the
  future-marker-clamp + deadman-predicate locks (50 tests).

### 2026-05-18 feature-dev pass — SWR cold-path failure observability + scorer-confidence bounded

**User-perspective testing surfaced a real production defect, not a missing
feature.** The `:8090` analytics surface is already very mature (~64 routes;
sector-heatmap / drawdown / calibration / suggestions / correlation / Calmar
all exist). The high-impact gap is **reliability/observability**, reproduced
live (read-only HTTP probes against the running service):

- **Observed (empirical, not inferred):** `/api/briefing` returned
  `{"warming":true}` on **8+ consecutive polls over 60s+**, never serving
  real data in-window; `news-edge` / `source-edge` / `decision-context`
  same. `/api/scorer-confidence` — the **one** expensive-replay endpoint
  **not** `@swr_cached` — hung the request thread `>30s` (curl code 000).
  `runner.log` carried **zero** SWR exception traces.
- **Root cause of the observability hole (proven):** `_swr_refresh._run`
  did `except Exception: return None`. A background rebuild that *raises*
  (vs. merely slow) populated the cache **never**, recorded the exception
  **nowhere** (no log, no counter, no placeholder field), and every poll
  re-served the same opaque `{"warming":true}` **forever**. 16 endpoints
  are exposed to this. An operator could not distinguish "slow, will
  self-heal" from "raising every cycle, will NEVER self-heal".
- **Deliberately NOT claimed:** whether briefing's specific never-warming
  is a raising handler vs. chronic `>TTL` slowness vs. pool starvation was
  *not* isolated (a fresh standalone import of `dashboard` blocks >70s, so
  the handler could not be cleanly bench-called out-of-process). The
  diagnostic surface is useful in all three cases; this commit is framed
  as *"add the diagnostic surface"*, not *"fixed briefing"*.

**Built (this commit — `paper_trader/dashboard.py` +
`tests/test_swr_failure_observability.py`):**

1. **SWR failure observability.** `_swr_entry` carries
   `fail_count / last_error / last_error_ts / last_ok_ts`. `_run` on
   exception increments the consecutive-failure count, records
   `Type: msg` (≤200 chars), and prints a **throttled** `[swr]` stderr
   line — the 1st failure (early warning) and every
   `_SWR_FAIL_LOG_EVERY=10`th (sustained), never once-per-poll. A
   successful build **resets** the streak (a transient blip is not
   reported forever). The cold placeholder now carries
   `attempts / last_error / stale_for_s` — `attempts==0 & last_error==None`
   ⇒ *slow but healthy* ("be patient"); `attempts>0` ⇒ *raising, will not
   self-heal* (actionable). Purely additive to the `{"warming":true}` body
   (verified: no exact-keyset consumer in tests/ or the template); the
   happy path is byte-identical.
2. **`/api/scorer-confidence` is now `@swr_cached("scorer-confidence",
   90.0)`** (TTL matches briefing / sector-heatmap / correlation — the
   other expensive ones). A cold scorer replay can no longer wedge a Flask
   request thread; it returns the bounded warming placeholder and
   self-heals. SWR is pytest-inert, so the existing exact-value
   `test_scorer_honesty.py` path is unchanged.

**Known upstream follow-up (NOT addressed here — different change,
different risk; flagged not silently fixed):** `_SWR_EXEC` has
`max_workers=6` but **16** `@swr_cached` endpoints, all cold-fetched on a
single dashboard load → guaranteed queue thrash under the documented load
avg ~23. If briefing's never-warming is mostly this, `attempts` will
correctly read `0` ("slow, not broken") indefinitely and the panel still
stays blank — the *observability is honest*, but the real lever is pool
sizing / cold-fetch fan-out, not this commit. `_SWR_COLD_BUDGET_S` and
`max_workers` were **deliberately left unchanged** (tuned for current
load; bumping them is a separate, riskier change that would muddy this
one).

**Operator action required:** live `:8090` runs stale code (chronic — see
CLAUDE.md §11 / project memory). The new diagnostic is inert until
`systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart paper-trader`.

**Tests:** `+5` in `tests/test_swr_failure_observability.py` (raising →
`attempts`/`last_error` surfaced & growing; slow → `attempts==0`/no error;
success resets then a fresh failure restarts at 1; consecutive failure
logs `[swr]` to stderr; scorer-confidence stays swr-wrapped — TDD,
RED→GREEN confirmed). Full suite **1613 passed** (+5 net), zero
regressions; SWR-adjacent set (`test_dashboard_swr`, `test_core_state_swr`,
`test_decision_context_endpoint`, `test_scorer_honesty`,
`test_core_dashboard_bounded_net`) 31 passed.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #15 (ML+backtest hybrid · gate economic counterfactual · decisive news-feature-deadness finding)

- **Phase 1 — no new bugs (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit).** Full
  re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`, `backtest.py`,
  `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus coupled `validation.py` /
  `calibration.py` / `gate_audit.py`: the `predict_with_meta`
  off-distribution gate-abstention path, the universal SELL
  `-forward_return_5d` sign-flip (train↔inference↔calibration↔gate↔
  `_oos_rank_metrics`↔`evaluate_scorer_oos`), the `(ticker,sim_date,
  action)` dedup key (correctly includes `action` so a BUY/SELL pair on
  one name/day with opposite labels both survive), the 5-trading-day
  forward-window guard, the `score=`/`scorer=` first-match
  disambiguation, the numpy-lstsq fallback weighted-LS scaler, the
  unlocked `_VOLUME_CACHE` membership read (safe: GIL-atomic `in`/`[]`,
  nothing ever deletes — the AGENTS.md concurrency invariant is about
  *iteration*), the `train_scorer` 80/20 split-before-scale, every
  module-global lock — all re-verified correct and exact-value
  test-locked. The temporal-boundary duplicate-straddle in
  `split_outcomes_temporal` is the **already-documented**
  `OOS_NOT_HELD_OUT` corpus-construction limitation (corpus_audit
  verdict), not a surgical code bug — and per CLAUDE.md §6 the split
  mechanism is training-dynamics, out of scope. Consistent with the
  documented 13+ prior no-new-bug ML/backtest passes — not a fabricated
  fix. ML/backtest regression 255/255 green before the feature, 280/280
  after.

- **Feature shipped (commit `35479f5`): gate economic counterfactual.**
  `paper_trader/ml/gate_pnl.py`. The gap it fills: `gate_audit` reports
  each arm's mean realized return and a verdict driven **solely** by
  `strong_tailwind_mean − strong_headwind_mean` — by construction it
  ignores the three middle arms (`mild_headwind` ×0.85, `neutral` ×1.00,
  `mild_tailwind` ×1.15) and how *often* each arm fires. A gate can read
  `GATE_EFFECTIVE`/`GATE_INEFFECTIVE` on the two-extreme spread while the
  **portfolio-level** effect is entirely different, because most of the
  reweighting happens in the populous middle arms. This computes the
  single economic number a quant deciding *whether to keep the gate*
  actually needs: the **assumption-free** equal-weight contribution
  `Σmᵢrᵢ/Σmᵢ − mean(rᵢ)` (gate-on minus gate-off realized mean, every
  base bet held equal — no conviction reconstruction needed, since the
  gate only *resizes* trades `_ml_decide` already picked) on the
  temporal-OOS slice. A base-conviction-weighted `sized_*` number
  (reconstructing `_ml_decide`'s `min(cap, ml_score/divisor)` incl. the
  leveraged-ETF/regime branch) is reported **informationally only —
  never folded into the verdict** (the `gate_audit` arm-monotone honesty
  pattern), because `ml_score` is the reasoning's 2-dp `score=` and the
  bull-vs-"unknown" regime at `regime_mult==1.0` is irreducible from the
  outcome row (cross-checked live: reconstructed base ≠ the reasoning's
  post-gate `conviction=` precisely *because* the latter already carries
  the multiplier — the formula structure is right, the residual is the
  gate itself + 2-dp rounding). Reuses `gate_audit.gate_arm` and
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` (single source of truth — the
  arms / OOS slice can never drift between the two gate diagnostics).
  Read-only, no train/pickle/`build_features`/`N_FEATURES`/trade touch,
  never raises, CLI exits 2 on `GATE_SUBTRACTS_RETURN`. **NOT wired into
  `main()` — zero deploy-stale impact, no loop restart needed.** 25
  exact-value locks in `tests/test_gate_pnl.py` (full verdict matrix at
  hand-computed `±3.6842`/`0.0` contributions; the SELL-sign-flip
  regression — without it GATE_ADDS reads GATE_RETURN_NEUTRAL; exact
  `1.9310` sized contribution; `_reconstruct_base_conviction` cap/divisor
  /leveraged/regime branches; OOS-slice restriction; `gate_arm is
  gate_audit.gate_arm` SSOT; never-raises).

- **Quant finding (NEW, headline — the gate's economic impact is
  ~0pp, not the +0.86pp the extreme-arm spread suggests).** Live pickle
  `n_train=3870`, gate active. **OOS slice (1418 fills):
  `GATE_RETURN_NEUTRAL`, equal-weight contribution +0.02pp** (gate-on
  +0.55% vs gate-off +0.53%, avg multiplier 0.96). The sibling
  `gate_audit` on the *same* slice reads `GATE_INEFFECTIVE` with a
  `strong_tailwind − strong_headwind` spread of **+0.86pp** — close
  enough to the ±1.0pp tolerance to look marginal — but rolled up across
  all five arms weighted by fire-frequency (`mild_headwind` n=570 @
  +0.68%, `neutral` n=505 @ +0.18%, `mild_tailwind` n=161 @ +1.27%,
  `strong_tailwind` n=115 @ +0.71%, `strong_headwind` n=67 @ −0.16%) the
  net portfolio contribution is **+0.02pp ≈ 0**. This is the decisive
  economic statement of the documented near-zero OOS skill: the gate
  (invariant #5, `gate_active` every cycle) underwrites **pure sizing
  variance with no compensating realized edge** — now quantified in
  realized-return pp, not rank-IC. In-sample `--all` reads +0.39pp
  (still NEUTRAL); the in-sample→OOS collapse mirrors the textbook
  overfit every prior pass documents. Cross-tool consistency confirms no
  drift: `calibration --oos` MISCALIBRATED (spearman 0.012 vs in-sample
  0.36), `gate_audit` GATE_INEFFECTIVE, `scorer_skill_log.jsonl`
  `oos_ic ≈ 0`. Reported, **not actioned** — turning the gate off is a
  training-dynamics change out of surgical scope (CLAUDE.md §6).

- **Quant finding (NEW, decisive — 2 of the 17 scorer features are
  constant noise in training).** `decision_outcomes.jsonl` (7093 rows):
  **98.1% have `news_article_count = NULL`** → `news_urgency` /
  `news_article_count` sit at their `build_features` defaults (50.0 /
  1.0) for 98% of training rows. The continuous loop draws deep
  historical windows (current corpus sim_dates **1996–2018**) where
  `digital-intern/articles.db` has effectively zero coverage, so almost
  every backtest decision is pure-quant. ~12% of the MLP's input
  dimensionality is therefore a near-constant the network can only
  memorize around — a concrete mechanism contributing to the
  `baseline_compare` "the net destroys the signal it is fed" finding.
  Reported, not actioned (feeding news into deep-history backtests, or
  pruning the dead features, is an architecture/training-dynamics change
  out of surgical scope, CLAUDE.md §6).

- **Quant findings (corroborating, not new).** Training tail = **5
  distinct run_ids (6227–6232)** spanning sim_date 1996–2018 — exactly
  `corpus_audit`'s `OOS_NOT_HELD_OUT`/`SINGLE_DRAW` (the temporal-OOS
  holdout is the late slice of the same ~5 runs, not an unseen draw).
  `forward_return_5d`: mean +1.26%, std 7.14, p1 −18.53, p99 +21.68,
  **only 0.08% exceed |50%|** — re-confirms `PRED_CLAMP_PCT=50` is amply
  load-bearing-safe (tighter than the AGENTS.md ~0.4% on the older 9k
  corpus). Action mix BUY 5526 / SELL 1567. `forward_return_10d` present
  on 0/7093 rows — the multi-horizon capture is still uncommitted
  in-flight work; legacy rows have no 10d/20d keys, as documented.

- **Operational (reconfirmed, out of scope):** winner→ArticleNet
  feedback loop still dead both ways — `continuous.log`: `[continuous]
  ml: trainer rc=-15 injected=10000` and `inject err: database locked
  after 4 attempts`. Matches passes #6–#13 (digital-intern GPU +
  `articles.db` write contention on the `/media/...` symlinked volume) —
  the loop is **not** "training on its winners". The scorer itself
  retrains cleanly every cycle (`scorer ok` every cycle, train_n growing
  3234→3485→3870, `val_rmse ≪ oos_rmse`). `backtest.db.local_backup` is
  a stale 2026-05-17 snapshot (max complete run_id=5) — the live symlink
  still times out per pass #13; `continuous.log` is fresh & mid-cycle.

- **Run the ML/backtest suite (now 280):** `cd
  /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest
  tests/test_decision_scorer.py tests/test_backtest.py
  tests/test_calibration.py tests/test_validation.py tests/test_continuous.py

  tests/test_baseline_compare.py tests/test_ml_backtest_review.py -q`
  (280 fast offline tests, green). `test_gate_pnl.py` holds the gate
  economic-counterfactual locks; it has none of "ml"/"backtest"/"scorer"
  in its node ids, so add it explicitly like `test_calibration.py` /
  `test_gate_audit.py`.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #15 (paper-trader core hybrid · NYSE half-day close fix · deployable-cash prompt block · live findings)

*(Numbered #15 alongside the ML/backtest #15 above — the established
two-entries-per-number convention, e.g. the dual #11/#14 passes.)*

- **Phase 1 — 1 bug fixed (commit `e556606`).**
  `dashboard._next_market_open()` computed the "next close" as a hardcoded
  `now_ny.replace(hour=16, …)`. But `market.is_market_open()` has enforced
  13:00 ET **early-close half-days** since `b6a1934` (`NYSE_HALF_DAYS_2026`
  = day-after-Thanksgiving 2026-11-27, Christmas Eve 2026-12-24), exposing
  `market.close_minute(d)` (780 half-day / 960 regular, minutes past ET
  midnight). So on those two sessions — while `is_market_open` correctly
  returned True 09:30–13:00 — the `/api/briefing` card ("Market OPEN —
  closes in 5h00m", *the first thing a trader sees on the pane each
  morning*) and `/api/game-plan`'s `next_open_seconds` reported the close
  **3h late**, exactly the figure a trader times exits on. Fix: derive the
  close from `market.close_minute(now_ny.date())` (`divmod` → hour/minute);
  regular sessions byte-identical. Locked by 2 new tests in
  `tests/test_core_dashboard_helpers.py::TestNextMarketOpen`
  (half-day → 13:00/2h; regular-day → 16:00/5h no-perturbation). RED
  before the fix.

- **Phase 2 — 1 feature (commit `b739a14`).** `analytics/buying_power.py`
  + `build_buying_power` — a **deployable-cash advisory block in the live
  Opus prompt**, the lean prompt-facing complement to the dashboard-only
  `capital_paralysis`. The mirrors (`self_review`/`track_record`/
  `risk_mirror`) + `event_calendar` all reach the prompt; the one
  *operational* fact still omitted is what a desk checks before every
  order — how much can I deploy, and if pinned what unlocks me? This is
  the **#2 documented live pathology** (pass #14 #4): a $972 book with
  ~$18 free across two underwater names, where Opus saw only a raw
  `cash: $18.49` line. `/api/capital-paralysis` synthesises it on the
  **dashboard**, but the decision engine never saw it — the
  `event_calendar` gap, one dimension over. Pure arithmetic over the
  **already-marked snapshot + already-fetched `watch_px`** `decide()`
  holds (NO extra store read, NO network — the `risk_mirror` hot-path
  discipline), scoped to the same `_names_in_play` set the quant /
  track-record blocks use. States: `DEPLOYABLE` (affordable whole-share
  counts, ≤6 names), `CASH_CONSTRAINED` (below every in-play price → only
  fractional / SELL / HOLD actionable + the most-underwater position whose
  exit frees the most cash, the `capital_paralysis` "biggest-loser-first"
  cut-priority), `NO_PRICED_NAMES`/`NO_DATA`/`ERROR` honest fallbacks.
  Observational only — autonomy preamble, **no directive verb**, no cap,
  never gates (invariants #2/#12, the `event_calendar` precedent);
  `_safe`-wrapped so a fault is "no block this cycle", **never** "no
  decision". Wired into `_build_payload(... buying_power_block=)`
  (rendered **last in the advisory stack — after `event_calendar`, before
  `WATCHLIST PRICES`**) + `decide()` (`_safe` try/except, after the
  `event_calendar` block); applies on next paper-trader restart. **No
  parity endpoint deliberately** — `/api/capital-paralysis` already serves
  this concern on the dashboard, so a `/api/buying-power` twin would
  duplicate it and add a concurrent-edit surface to the contested
  `dashboard.py` for no operator gain. Smoke-tested live on the real
  pinned book: `CASH_CONSTRAINED · $18.49 free (98.1% deployed) · cheapest
  in-play SOXL @ $28 · most-underwater LITE ($-6.21) frees ≈$592`. Locked
  by `tests/test_buying_power.py` (17 tests: live pinned-book shape;
  strict `int(cash//px)` floor + `cash==price` boundary;
  zero/negative/None price excluded; not-in-play excluded; unlock
  loser-vs-largest-mark pick; `_position_mark_value` consumes the enriched
  `market_value` and never re-derives the option ×100; observational
  voice; `_build_payload` last-in-stack placement + `None`-no-stray;
  never-raises-on-garbage).

- **Phase 3 — live findings (1–5; none a quick safe code fix).**
  1. **`/api/liquidity` field/headline semantic inconsistency.** For the
     live $18.49 (1.9%) book the endpoint returns `can_act_on_signal:
     true` *next to* a headline reading "Pinned … **no room to act**".
     Root cause: `can_act = cash>=1.0 and cash_pct>=1.0` but the
     `NO_DRY_POWDER`/"no room to act" headline triggers at `cash_pct<2.0`
     — the thresholds disagree in the `[1%,2%)` band, exactly where the
     live book sits. Each number is individually correct (a fractional
     order *is* possible at $18); only the prose overstates. **Reported,
     not fixed:** `liquidity.py` is a deliberately-designed,
     heavily-tested builder `capital_paralysis` composes verbatim
     (single-source-of-truth) and sibling agents are actively editing —
     churning its field semantics for a wording nit risks the composition
     + a merge collision (the "deliberately weird, leave it" category). A
     future pass that *does* touch it should align the two thresholds (or
     soften the headline to "minimal room") and re-pin the
     `capital_paralysis` composition.
  2. **NO_DECISION ~59% lifetime / 60% (24h)** — confirmed unchanged,
     uniformly `"claude returned no response (timeout/empty)"` under host
     load ~17 (`/api/decision-health`: `no_decision_rate_24h 60.3`,
     `last_fill_ts` 23.7h ago). NOT a parser bug, NOT quota
     (`quota_exhausted` unset) — the long-standing contention diagnosis
     (CLAUDE.md §11; passes #6–#14). The lever is host load, not code; the
     Phase-2 block does not fix timeouts but makes the cycles that *do*
     complete materially more decision-useful on the pinned book.
  3. **Capital paralysis active & bleeding alpha (the Phase-2
     justification).** `/api/capital-paralysis`: 98.1% deployed, "inaction
     has cost **-2.21% alpha** (6 paralysis drought(s))",
     `cycles_since_last_fill 55`, last fill ~24h ago, LITE 60.9% of book.
     Real, ongoing, measurably costly.
  4. **`/api/build-info` `behind:1 stale:true`** at session start, but the
     sole missing commit was docs-only (a pass-#14 `AGENTS.md` entry); the
     git-watcher auto-fast-forwards (observed in `runner.log`:
     "fast-forwarding your working tree from commit 3b09f87"). Self-healing
     — no action. The runner-restart churn ("another paper trader is
     already running … exiting") is the singleton flock **working** during
     the concurrent-deploy storm (pass #14 #3.2) — noisy, safe.
  5. **Positives verified:** `/` 200 in **38 ms**; `/api/state` SWR-served
     (`cached:true`, age 34s — by design) with the full correct shape;
     `runner-heartbeat` HEALTHY, singleton **acquired** (not degraded),
     Discord delivery **HEALTHY**; `/api/feed-health` HEALTHY (566 live
     articles/2h, not split-brain); decisions on cadence (last 79s ago).
     The system is operationally sound; its two real problems (host-load
     timeouts, data-corruption paralysis) are documented ops/data issues,
     not core code defects.

- **Concurrency note for the next agent.** This pass ran with ≥3 sibling
  agents committing in parallel (observed: `reporter.py`, the
  `analytics_api` `mark_trust` block in `dashboard.py`, `/api/supervision`,
  `feat(ml) gate economic counterfactual`, a parallel `AGENTS.md` #15
  append). `git add <file>` restages the **whole** working tree — it
  silently captures a sibling's in-progress hunk. The safe pattern used
  here: extract only your own hunk (`git diff` → filter → `git apply
  --cached --recount`) for any file a sibling also touched (`dashboard.py`,
  `AGENTS.md`), and only `git add` whole files exclusively yours (new
  modules, new test files, `strategy.py` here). Verify with `git diff
  --cached -- <file> | grep -c <sibling-token>` == 0 before every commit.

- **Run the suite:** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader &&
  python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` (full). Fast subset for this pass:
  `python3 -m pytest tests/test_buying_power.py
  tests/test_core_dashboard_helpers.py tests/test_core_strategy.py
  tests/test_event_calendar.py -q`.

### 2026-05-18 feature-dev pass (Agent 4) — live-book SECTOR concentration in the decision prompt

- **1 feature.** `paper_trader/analytics/sector_exposure.py` +
  `build_sector_exposure` — **the live book's sector concentration + the
  marginal in-play sector impact, fed into the live Opus decision prompt.**
  `risk_mirror` (pass 2026-05-17) closed *name*-level concentration (top
  weight / HHI by ticker). The book's documented **#3 pathology is exactly
  one dimension over** — *sector* clustering: `risk_mirror.py`'s own
  docstring names it ("the book 60.9% in one name's **sector** … the
  dashboard already exposes both … but the decision engine itself never saw
  them"). `/api/analytics` computes `sector_exposure_pct` and `/api/risk`
  per-position sector, but **the decision path had zero sector awareness**
  (`grep sector paper_trader/strategy.py` prompt path → 0 hits). The marginal
  question a desk checks before every order — *does this trade pile onto my
  single most concentrated sector?* — was invisible at decision time. This is
  the lean, prompt-facing complement to the dashboard-only sector breakdown,
  the same gap `risk_mirror`/`event_calendar`/`buying_power` each closed one
  dimension over. Smoke on the documented ~$973 book: `CONCENTRATED · top
  OPTICAL 60.7% · HHI 0.46 · 3 sector(s)`, and the marginal line correctly
  flags `LITE→OPTICAL (60.7% — your heaviest sector)` while tagging
  `TQQQ→BROAD_LEV (0.0% — diversifying)`.

- **Single source of truth.** The book-sector % mirrors `dashboard.py`'s
  `analytics_api` formula **verbatim** (`price = current_price or avg_cost;
  val = price*qty*(100 if option else 1); pct = val/total*100`, classified by
  `SECTOR_MAP`), so `/api/sector-exposure` is *numerically identical* to
  `/api/analytics` `sector_exposure_pct` for the same store. `SECTOR_MAP` /
  `classify` are a **test-pinned verbatim copy** of
  `dashboard.SECTOR_MAP`/`_classify` — duplicated **deliberately** (the
  `strategy._ml_live_opinion` precedent: importing the ~9k-line Flask
  `dashboard` onto the live decision hot path is a fragility a `_safe`
  wrapper should never have to catch, and a sibling edit that broke that
  import would silently re-blind the desk; the existing test suite already
  imports `dashboard` universally, so the drift test pays no *new* Flask
  cost). `tests/test_sector_exposure.py::TestDriftLocks` asserts byte-equality
  with `dashboard.SECTOR_MAP`, that `classify == dashboard._classify`, and
  that `SECTOR_HEAVY_PCT == game_plan._SECTOR_HEAVY_PCT == 60.0` — any drift
  fails CI. (Distinct from `buying_power`, which matches
  `/api/capital-paralysis` and prefers enriched `market_value`; this matches
  `/api/analytics`, a different SSoT — keeping the formula identical is what
  makes the parity test exact.)

- **Observational only, never gates** (invariants #2/#12 — the
  `risk_mirror`/`buying_power` contract). The preamble disclaims directive/
  limit and reaffirms full autonomy; the block states facts (per-sector %,
  sector-HHI + label, which in-play names sit in an already-heavy sector) and
  issues **no fabricated fill-size projection** (Opus chooses size — the
  honest deterministic fact is "MU is SEMIS, SEMIS is already 61% of your
  book", not an invented "would take 61%→73%"). States `NO_DATA`
  (no priced book — the `buying_power` fallback) → `DIVERSIFIED` →
  `CONCENTRATED` (top sector ≥ the drift-locked 60.0% heavy mark). Pure,
  deterministic, never raises (the `_safe` contract; the `decide()` caller
  also wraps it → a fault is "no sector block this cycle", never "no
  decision this cycle").

- **Wiring.** `decide()` (try/except, after `risk_mirror`, before
  `event_calendar`) + `_build_payload(... sector_exposure_block=)` rendered
  **immediately after `risk_section`, before `event_section`** (structural
  risk by name → by sector → then what is *coming*). Scoped to the same lean
  `_names_in_play(positions, merged, WATCHLIST)` set the quant /
  track-record / buying-power blocks use (the marginal view matches "what
  matters this cycle"). Served at **`/api/sector-exposure`** (prompt↔endpoint
  parity — `/api/analytics` and `/api/risk` left untouched, different
  concerns, already tested).

- **Tests — 24, all green; full suite 1640 passed, 0 failed, 0
  regressions.** `tests/test_sector_exposure.py` (22): SECTOR_MAP /
  threshold / classify drift-locks; **every WATCHLIST ticker is classified**
  (a future watchlist add missing a SECTOR_MAP entry fails here, not silently
  becomes "% other"); hand-computed exposure %, top-sector, and sector-HHI
  (0.4321 on a known book); option ×100; avg_cost fallback; CONCENTRATED
  flips exactly at 60.0 (>=, not 60.01); deterministic tie-break (top ==
  breakdown[0]); **parity** (builder `sector_pct` == an independent
  `analytics_api`-formula recompute); marginal heavy/diversifying flags +
  riskiest-first sort; NO_DATA / None-snapshot; never-raises-on-garbage;
  observational voice (no directive verb, autonomy preamble); `_build_payload`
  wiring + None-renders-nothing + after-risk-mirror placement.
  `tests/test_sector_exposure_endpoint.py` (2): the real `/api/sector-exposure`
  Flask view on a fresh temp `Store` returns the expected concentrated shape,
  **and `/api/sector-exposure` `sector_pct` == `/api/analytics`
  `sector_exposure_pct`** end-to-end (the SSoT promise proven through the app,
  not a `__main__` smoke — the paper-trader-analytics-verification note).

- **Deploy caveat (the chronic-stale pattern).** The live trader runs many
  commits behind until a manual restart (CLAUDE.md / passes #6–#15); this
  feature is **committed but inert until the next paper-trader restart** —
  `/api/build-info` will read `behind`/`stale` until then. Not restarted here
  (documented dual-systemd-scope footgun). "Shipped" ≠ "deployed".

- **Concurrency.** Ran with ≥3 sibling agents committing in parallel (HEAD
  moved `f29e134`→`5f40009` mid-pass; sibling-dirty `reporter.py` /
  `test_core_reporter.py` / `test_runner_heartbeat.py` and untracked
  `game_plan.py` / `gate_pnl.py` / … are **not mine — never staged**). New
  module + 2 new test files + the brainstorm doc are exclusively mine
  (`git add` whole). `strategy.py` / `dashboard.py` / `AGENTS.md` are
  contested → only my own hunks staged by path, `git diff --cached` verified
  to contain zero sibling tokens before commit. Brainstorm/decision recorded
  in `docs/feature-dev-sector-exposure-2026-05-18.md`.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #16 (ML+backtest hybrid · scorer response-shape audit · decisive rsi-inversion finding)

- **Phase 1 — no new production bug (bugs_fixed = 0).** Full re-trace of
  `decision_scorer.py`, `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus
  coupled `validation.py` / `calibration.py`: the `predict_with_meta`
  off-distribution abstention, the universal SELL `-forward_return_5d`
  flip (train↔inference↔calibration↔gate↔`_oos_rank_metrics`↔
  `evaluate_scorer_oos`), the `(ticker,sim_date,action)` dedup key, the
  5-trading-day forward-window guard, the `score=`/`scorer=` first-match
  disambiguation, the numpy-lstsq weighted-LS fallback, the atomic
  tmp+`.replace` JSONL/pickle trims, the `_inject_and_train` 11-col
  INSERT tuple, every module-global lock — all re-verified correct and
  exact-value test-locked. Consistent with the documented 14+ prior
  no-new-bug ML/backtest passes. **Phase 1 deliverable (commit
  `b82f09e`, `test:`):** the existing `TestRiskExits` cases only asserted
  *an exit happened* (`n_exits==1`, `triggered_price >= 120.0`) — they did
  not pin the price/day the SL/TP daily scan fires at, so an off-by-one in
  the scan boundary (`cur = from_day + timedelta(days=1)`, `px <= sl` vs
  `px < sl`, partial- vs whole-position sell) slipped through. Added two
  exact-value regression locks against the deterministic synthetic series
  (`SPY[days[i]] == 100.0 + i`): TP fires at `days[20]`/**120.0** with cash
  exactly **600.0**; SL fires at `days[1]`/**101.0** (NOT `days[0]`/100.0 —
  locking the deliberate one-day scan offset) with cash exactly **901.0**.
  Additive; existing tests untouched. ML/backtest regression 280→321 green.

- **Feature shipped (`paper_trader/ml/response_audit.py`; landed in commit
  `b471188` via the shared-index race — see concurrency note).** Every
  documented inertness verdict (`skill_trend` ≈0 OOS, `gate_audit`
  GATE_INEFFECTIVE, `gate_pnl` ≈+0.1pp, `calibration --oos`
  MISCALIBRATED) is a **statistical summary**. `feature_importance`
  reports *how much* skill scrambling a feature costs but is **sign-blind**
  — it cannot say a feature the model relies on is bent the economically
  *backwards* way. `response_audit` is the missing **geometric**
  complement: **ICE-then-average** (per-record curves over the OOS slice's
  empirical p5..p95, all other features kept REAL then averaged — NOT
  PDP-at-median, which would fabricate off-distribution combos and measure
  the clamped-±50 head instead of learned structure). Primary verdict is
  **sign-agnostic** (`FLAT_NO_RESPONSE` / `RESPONSIVE_MONOTONE` /
  `RESPONSIVE_JAGGED` / `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`); the economic-sign tally is
  **informational only, never in the verdict** (the SELL flip makes the
  target a BUY/SELL blend, so a "wrong" sign is not provably a defect —
  the `gate_audit` arm-monotone honesty pattern). Reuses
  `calibration._spearman` (tie-aware — load-bearing at the ±`PRED_CLAMP_PCT`
  clamp) and `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` (SSOT — same OOS slice as
  every sibling tool). Read-only: no train/pickle/`build_features`/
  `N_FEATURES`/trade touch, never raises, CLI exit 2 on FLAT/JAGGED.
  **NOT wired into `main()` — zero deploy-stale impact, no loop restart
  needed.** 26 exact-value locks in `tests/test_response_audit.py`
  (ICE-vs-PDP mean≠median lock, monotone-but-wrong-sign still
  RESPONSIVE_MONOTONE, constant→FLAT, symmetric-U→JAGGED, FLAT_TOL
  boundary, degenerate-feature handling, SSOT identity, never-raises on

- **Quant finding (NEW, decisive — the geometric mechanism for the
  documented near-zero OOS skill).** Live pickle `n_train=3894`, gate
  active. The scorer is **NOT flat-noise** — it moves materially (max
  response ~6.9pp) — but its single **largest** learned lever is
  **economically inverted**: `rsi` has the biggest response range of any
  feature (~6.9pp OOS / ~6.8pp in-sample) and the model bends it
  **spearman +0.82 OOS / +0.95 in-sample** — *higher* predicted 5d return
  for *higher/overbought* RSI (momentum-on-RSI, the **opposite** of the
  mean-reversion prior). Only `bb_position` is consistently coherent
  (spearman −1.0 OOS / −0.82 in-sample, sign ✓ both slices). Verdict
  degrades **RESPONSIVE_MONOTONE in-sample (4/7 sign-consistent) →
  RESPONSIVE_JAGGED OOS (3/7 monotone, 2/6 sign-consistent)**: `mom5`/
  `mom20` flip slope sign across the temporal split — the textbook overfit
  signature, now shown geometrically rather than as another scalar IC.
  No prior tool localized *which* learned relationship drives the ~0 OOS
  skill; this does: the model's dominant signal is backwards and its
  momentum response is sign-unstable. **Reported, not actioned** —
  retraining/feature surgery is training-dynamics, out of surgical scope
  (CLAUDE.md §6).

- **Quant findings (corroborating, fresh live numbers).**
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` now **7858 rows** (BUY 5978 / SELL 1880),
  `forward_return_5d` mean +1.35 std 7.47 p1 −18.0 p99 +23.9, only
  **0.10% exceed |50%|** — re-confirms `PRED_CLAMP_PCT=50` is amply
  load-bearing-safe. **98.3% have `news_article_count = NULL`** →
  `response_audit` independently flags BOTH news features `degenerate` on
  every slice **and additionally `regime_mult` degenerate on the deep-
  history OOS slice** (the 1996–2018 corpus is uniformly "unknown→1.0"
  regime) — 2–3 of 17 inputs carry no training variance, sharpening pass
  #15's "2 dead features". `calibration --oos` MISCALIBRATED (spearman
  0.088, decile err 5.4pp) vs in-sample DIRECTIONAL_BUT_BIASED (spearman
  0.289) — the textbook in-sample→OOS collapse. `gate_pnl` OOS
  GATE_RETURN_NEUTRAL, equal-weight contribution **+0.11pp** (gate-on
  +0.38% vs gate-off +0.26%) — the gate underwrites pure sizing variance.
  `scorer_skill_log` last 6 cycles oos_ic ∈ {0.07,0.01,0.19,0.02,0.02,
  −0.01}, oos_dir_acc ≈ 0.50. Backtest dispersion stays leverage-driven
  (run 6230 +484.75%/vs_spy +396.7% beside run 6231 −49.44%).

- **Operational (reconfirmed, out of scope).** Continuous loop healthy:
  476 complete / 20 failed / 4 running, cycles 13–27 min, `scorer ok`
  every cycle (train_n 3234→3894). Winner→ArticleNet feedback loop still
  **dead both ways**: `continuous.log` shows `inject err: database locked
  after 4 attempts` and `trainer timeout (injected 2994)` — matches
  passes #6–#15 (digital-intern GPU + `articles.db` write contention on
  the symlinked volume). The scorer itself retrains cleanly; the loop is
  **not** training ArticleNet on its winners.

- **Concurrency note for the next agent.** This pass ran with ≥3 sibling
  agents committing in parallel. Observed concretely: a sibling's
  whole-index commit (`b471188 feat(strategy): … sector-exposure`) swept
  this pass's *already-staged* `response_audit.py` + `test_response_audit.py`
  into THAT commit before this agent's path-scoped `git commit -- <paths>`
  ran (which then found "no changes"). **The code/tests are durably on
  `origin/master` and 26/26 green** — only the commit-message attribution
  is the sibling's, not this agent's. Rewriting shared history with live
  concurrent agents is more dangerous than the misattribution, so it was
  left as-is. Lesson: in this monorepo a brand-new file is NOT safe from
  the shared index either — a sibling's `git add -A`/whole-tree commit
  captures anything staged. There is no fully race-free path short of a
  per-agent worktree; verify your deliverable is on `origin` by content
  (`git cat-file -e origin/master:<path>` + line-count), not by assuming
  it sits in your own commit.

- **Run the ML/backtest suite (now 321 in the listed subset):** `cd
  /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest
  tests/test_decision_scorer.py tests/test_backtest.py
  tests/test_calibration.py tests/test_validation.py tests/test_continuous.py

  tests/test_baseline_compare.py tests/test_ml_backtest_review.py
  tests/test_feature_importance.py tests/test_response_audit.py -q`.
  `test_response_audit.py` has none of "ml"/"backtest"/"scorer" in its
  node ids — add it explicitly like `test_calibration.py` /
  `test_gate_pnl.py`.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #16 (paper-trader core hybrid · decision-context advisory-block omission · capital-paralysis Discord pulse · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — 1 bug fixed (in HEAD via commit `5f40009`; see Concurrency
  note).** `analytics/decision_context.py` — `/api/decision-context`
  (the operator's **only** window into "what is the live trader actually
  shown right now?", whose docstring promises a string "byte-identical to
  the live prompt given identical inputs", single-source-of-truth
  invariant #10) reconstructed the prompt via `strategy._build_payload`
  but **never threaded `event_calendar_block` (forward earnings) or
  `buying_power_block` (deployable cash)** — both wired into the real
  `decide()` (`buying_power` since `b739a14`; `event_calendar` earlier).
  The inspector silently dropped **2 of 6 advisory blocks**: a trader
  curl-ing the endpoint to audit "did Opus get the buying-power /
  upcoming-earnings awareness this cycle?" got a false **NO**, and
  `advisory_blocks` lacked both keys entirely (a `KeyError` for any
  consumer iterating the documented set). Root cause: the inspector was
  built before those two blocks were added to `decide()` and never
  updated — exactly the class of regression that escapes a per-file
  review. Fix: add both kwargs to `build_decision_context`, pass them to
  `_build_payload`, report them in `advisory_blocks`, update the
  `__main__` CLI line, and build them in `assemble_inputs` **mirroring
  `decide()` byte-for-byte** (`event_calendar` scope = held ∪ the FULL
  `WATCHLIST` — *not* the lean `_names_in_play` set, which would
  re-blind the reconstruction the same way it would re-blind the live
  desk; `buying_power` scoped to `_names_in_play`). **Verified live:** the
  reconstructed prompt grew `8984→10002` chars (exactly the two omitted
  blocks) and the CLI now reports `event_calendar=True buying_power=True`.
  Locked by 5 RED-before regression tests
  (`test_decision_context.py::TestNewAdvisoryBlocksReachPrompt` — verbatim
  text + flags + `_build_payload` byte-faithful ordering;
  `TestInputSummary::test_advisory_block_flags` updated to the 6-key
  contract; `test_decision_context_endpoint.py::…test_buying_power_block_
  reaches_reconstructed_prompt` — the `assemble_inputs` wiring).

- **Phase 2 — 1 feature.** `reporter._capital_pulse_line` — a
  **capital-paralysis pulse in the hourly / daily-close Discord
  summary**. The #2 documented live pathology (pass #14 #4): a book
  pinned near 98% deployed with ~$18 free, unable to act for a day while
  involuntary NO_DECISION droughts bleed alpha. `capital_paralysis`
  serves this on the **dashboard** and `buying_power` now reaches the
  **Opus prompt** — but the operator, who lives in **Discord**, still got
  hourly/daily summaries that never said the desk was frozen and bleeding.
  This routes the existing builder's own verdict to the surface the
  operator actually reads (the exact dashboard→prompt→Discord trajectory
  `buying_power` followed, one surface over). Composes
  `build_capital_paralysis` **verbatim** (single source of truth,
  invariant #10 — headline / unlock / verdict are the builder's, never
  re-derived, so this line, `/api/capital-paralysis` and the prompt-side
  `buying_power` can never drift). **Pure store reads, NO network** (the
  Discord-path discipline — unlike `_benchmark_line` it adds zero
  latency). Observational only, no caps, never gates (invariants #2/#12;
  the `_hold_discipline_line` / `_benchmark_line` precedent). Suppression:
  `NO_DATA` and a healthy `FREE`-not-bleeding book are silent (nothing
  actionable); `PINNED`/`EMPTY` are **always** surfaced, and — the key
  subtlety — a `FREE` book whose involuntary-drought verdict is
  `BLEEDING` IS surfaced. That is the **live 2026-05-18 state**:
  `can_act_on_signal:true` (→ state `FREE`) masks that the desk has bled
  **-2.21% alpha across 6 involuntary droughts**; the verbatim live
  render is `**CAPITAL** ◈ FREE / > FREE — $18.49 cash (1.9%) available …
  / > 2.21% of alpha lost across 6 involuntary (parse-failure) droughts —
  the NO_DECISION problem is costing real performance`. Wired into both
  `send_hourly_summary` and `send_daily_close` (after the existing
  behavioural / hold-discipline blocks). Locked by 14 tests in
  `tests/test_capital_pulse.py` (suppression × NO_DATA/missing-state/
  FREE-healthy/non-dict/empty-headline; surfaced × PINNED-verbatim-with-
  unlock-and-reason / FREE-but-BLEEDING-live-state / minimal-no-unlock /
  garbage-frees_usd-no-crash; failure contract × builder-raises /
  store-raises → "" never raises; end-to-end × hourly + daily wiring +
  healthy-book-adds-no-noise regression).

- **Phase 3 — live findings (1–6; none a new quick safe code fix —
  finding 1 *became* the Phase-1 fix).**
  1. **`/api/decision-context` under-reported what Opus sees** — the
     Phase-1 bug, found by curl-ing the endpoint as a trader and diffing
     it against the `buying_power` smoke test (HAS BUYING POWER: False on
     the endpoint, fully rendered by the builder). Fixed this pass.
  2. **The live trader is UNSUPERVISED.** `/api/supervision` (the brand-
     new `dde6ee5`-era endpoint) correctly reports `orphan:true ppid:1
     supervised:false verdict:UNSUPERVISED`: the running pid (booted on
     `b82f09e`, current) is parented to init, **not** under
     `systemd --user` (`Failed to connect to bus: No medium found`). The
     git-watcher's deferred-restart + deadman force-exit logic
     **assumes** `systemd Restart=always` brings the process back on new
     code; an orphan with no supervisor that cleanly exits to apply a
     commit (or hits the deadman) just **dies**. Something external is
     currently relaunching it (boot_sha advanced `f29e134→b82f09e`
     mid-session) but there is no durable safety net. Real ops risk;
     **reported, not fixed** — touching the live process / systemd unit
     is out of scope and high-risk for a code pass. The new
     `/api/supervision` endpoint itself works correctly and is the right
     surface for this.
  3. **NO_DECISION ~59.5% lifetime / ~50% (24h)** — 458/770 lifetime,
     43/85 in 24h, uniformly `"claude returned no response
     (timeout/empty)"`; `quota_exhausted` unset. Unchanged, the
     long-standing host-load contention diagnosis (CLAUDE.md §11; passes
     #6–#15). Not a code defect; the lever is host load.
  4. **Capital paralysis active & bleeding (the Phase-2 justification).**
     `/api/capital-paralysis`: $18.49 cash (1.9%), 98.1% deployed, LITE
     61% of book, `cycles_since_last_fill 58`, last fill ~24h ago,
     `involuntary_alpha_bleed_pct -2.213` across 6 droughts, verdict
     `BLEEDING`. Real, ongoing, measurably costly — now visible in
     Discord (Phase 2).
  5. **`/api/capital-paralysis` self-contradiction in the [1%,2%) band,
     still present.** `can_act_on_signal:true` + `liquidity_status:
     NO_DRY_POWDER` + a `FREE — …the book can act…` headline while 98.1%
     deployed and `flags:["98.1% of book deployed", …]`. This is the
     **pass #15 finding #1** (the `liquidity.py` `can_act` vs
     `NO_DRY_POWDER` threshold disagreement in `cash_pct∈[1,2)`),
     **confirmed unchanged** at `cash_pct 1.9`. Still the
     "deliberately-weird, contested-builder, leave-it" category — a
     future pass that *does* touch `liquidity.py` should align the two
     thresholds and re-pin the `capital_paralysis` composition. NB: the
     Phase-2 pulse intentionally keys off the *paralysis* verdict
     (`BLEEDING`), **not** `can_act`, so it correctly surfaces this book
     despite the headline saying "FREE … can act".
  6. **MU position phantom-flat (stale mark, known/handled).** Live book:
     `MU stock qty=0.5 avg=724.12 now=724.12 P/L $+0.00` — the documented
     stale-mark case (yfinance returned no price → marked at cost,
     `stale_mark` flag set; surfaced as `[STALE MARK …]` in the prompt
     and `⚠ STALE` in `_portfolio_lines`). Working as designed; noted so
     a future agent does not misread the $0.00 P/L as a genuinely flat
     position.
  7. **Positives verified:** `/` 200 in 0.85s; `/api/runner-heartbeat`
     HEALTHY, singleton **acquired** (pid 1786434, not degraded),
     notify/Discord **HEALTHY**; `/api/build-info` not stale (boot==head);
     decisions on the 60m closed-market cadence (last 8m ago);
     `buying_power` smoke test renders the correct `CASH_CONSTRAINED`
     block verbatim on the live pinned book. The system is operationally
     sound; its real problems (host-load timeouts, data-corruption
     paralysis, no supervisor) are documented ops/data issues, not core
     code defects.

- **Concurrency note for the next agent — `git commit -- <pathspec>`
  defeats partial staging.** This pass ran with ≥3 sibling agents
  committing in parallel (observed: `feat(briefing)` `5f40009`,
  `notify_health`/`_record_send_outcome` in `reporter.py`, `dashboard.py`
  mark-trust/supervision, `sector_exposure.py`, parallel `AGENTS.md`
  appends). **Two attribution swaps happened, neither lost code:** (a)
  Phase-1's `decision_context.py` + 2 test files, after a clean
  `git add`, were swept into a sibling's `5f40009 feat(briefing)` commit
  before this agent's own commit landed; (b) Phase-2 carefully extracted
  *only* its `reporter.py` hunks into the index via `git diff | filter |
  git apply --cached --recount` (verified `git diff --cached |
  grep -c <sibling-token>` == 0) — but the subsequent
  `git commit -m … -- paper_trader/reporter.py …` **commits the
  working-tree file, not the index**, so the sibling's complete (and
  separately tested) `notify_health` work rode along under the Phase-2
  message. **Lesson:** the index-extraction discipline only holds if you
  commit the **index** (`git commit` with NO pathspec, after staging
  exactly your hunks and confirming `git diff --cached --name-only` +
  zero sibling tokens) — adding `-- <pathspec>` silently re-snapshots the
  whole working-tree file and re-imports sibling hunks. In this repo's
  trunk-based + auto-push-daemon model the *code* is never lost (every
  full-suite run stayed green: 1613→1640→1682) and history rewrite on
  `master` against the daemon is far more dangerous than muddied
  attribution — so accept it, verify HEAD parses + tests green, and move
  on (this pass did: `python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(...)"` on
  `HEAD:reporter.py`, 94 targeted + 1682 full green).

- **Run the suite:** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader &&
  python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` (full; ~50–200s). Fast subset for this
  pass: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_capital_pulse.py
  tests/test_decision_context.py tests/test_decision_context_endpoint.py
  tests/test_core_reporter.py -q`.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #17 (ML+backtest hybrid · durable trivial-baseline ledger · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, commit guard
  explicitly permits).** Full re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`,
  `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus coupled
  `validation.py` / `calibration.py` / `baseline_compare.py` /
  `skill_trend.py`: the `predict_with_meta` off-distribution abstention,
  the universal SELL `-forward_return_5d` flip
  (train↔inference↔calibration↔gate↔`_oos_rank_metrics`↔
  `evaluate_scorer_oos`↔`baseline_compare`), the `(ticker,sim_date,
  action)` dedup key, the 5-trading-day forward-window guard, the
  `score=`/`scorer=`/`news_urg=`/`news_count=` reasoning regexes, the
  numpy-lstsq weighted-LS fallback (fits scaler on full X with
  `val_rmse=nan` — by-design fallback, locked by
  `test_ml_backtest_coverage.py`, not a leak bug), the atomic
  tmp+`.replace` JSONL/pickle trims, the `_inject_and_train` 11-col
  INSERT tuple + lock-retry, the singleton-reset under
  `_DECISION_SCORER_LOCK`, the `_LOAD_CACHE` (path,mtime_ns,size) key
  (atomic replace ⇒ key changes ⇒ per-cycle pickup), every module-global
  lock — all re-verified correct and exact-value test-locked. Consistent
  with the documented 15+ prior no-new-bug ML/backtest passes. No
  test-hardening commit either: the Phase-1 checklist items (known
  feature-vector score range / kw-rank ordering / null-safe defaults;
  synthetic BUY-and-hold + exact SL/TP price+cash — the latter freshly
  pinned by pass-#16 `b82f09e`; results-location + no-silent-overwrite)
  are already exact-value locked; a redundant test would be churn, not
  hardening. ML/backtest regression 374/374 green before the feature,
  380/380 after.

- **Feature shipped (commit `6ade72d`, `feat(continuous):`): durable
  per-cycle trivial-baseline ledger.** `run_continuous_backtests.py::
  _append_baseline_skill_log` + `BASELINE_SKILL_LOG`/`_KEEP` constants,
  wired into `main()` immediately after the scorer-skill-ledger block.
  **The gap it fills:** `baseline_compare`'s `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL`
  (raw `ml_score` carries higher OOS rank-IC than the 17-feature MLP the
  conviction gate relies on) is the single most economically decisive
  documented ML/backtest finding (~10 prior passes) — yet it was *only*
  observable by an operator manually running
  `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.baseline_compare`. There was **no durable,
  trendable signal** an unattended loop surfaced — the *exact*
  dead-audit-trail gap the pass-#15 `_append_scorer_skill_log` wiring fix
  closed for the scorer ledger (`scorer_skill_log.jsonl`/`skill_trend`),
  applied to the sibling decisive question. `scorer_skill_log` only ever
  trends `oos_rmse` vs a **constant** mean-predictor; *nothing* durably
  trended "does a one-liner beat the net this cycle". The new ledger row
  is `{cycle, timestamp, window_*, status, verdict, slice, n, n_train,
  mlp_rank_ic, mlp_dir_acc, best_baseline, best_baseline_ic, ic_gap,
  gate_active}`. **SSOT, never a re-derivation:** it calls
  `baseline_compare.analyze` *verbatim* — the same
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` slice + universal SELL sign-flip
  as `calibration --oos` and the scorer ledger's OOS metrics — so the
  persisted `mlp_rank_ic` equals the CLI's / `calibration --oos`'s **by
  construction** (a built-in no-drift cross-check, exact-value
  test-locked). `gate_active` mirrors invariant #5 (deployed
  `n_train ≥ 500`), so a `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` + `gate_active=True`
  row is the quant-decisive *"the loop is sizing on a net the data says
  is worse than a free one-liner, right now"* state. Best-effort by
  construction (never raises — an untrained scorer / missing-or-short
  outcomes file / a raising `analyze` all degrade to an **honest**
  `status='error' verdict='INSUFFICIENT_DATA'` row so a trend gap is
  *visible*, never a silently-skipped cycle), atomic bounded trim at
  `BASELINE_SKILL_LOG_KEEP=2000` (the decision_outcomes idiom). **Applies
  on next `run_continuous_backtests.py` restart** (the running loop
  predates this commit — inert until restart, exactly the documented
  deploy-stale pattern). Ledger lives at `data/baseline_skill_log.jsonl`
  (gitignored-by-symlink like every sibling ledger — never staged). 6
  exact-value locks in `tests/test_continuous.py`
  (`TestAppendBaselineSkillLog`: SSOT cross-check vs
  `scorer_baseline_compare` — `mlp_rank_ic`/`best_baseline`/`ic_gap`/
  `verdict` must be byte-identical; honest untrained-`INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
  row; `analyze`-raises → honest error row + still returns True;
  past-2×-keep atomic trim with newest-survives; never-raises on
  unwritable path; + `TestCycleWiringRegression::
  test_main_invokes_baseline_skill_ledger` source-level wiring lock so a
  refactor can't silently re-orphan it the way the scorer ledger was
  until pass #15).
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_continuous.py -v -k "Baseline or CycleWiring"
  # the CLI the ledger records, for ad-hoc reads:
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.baseline_compare
  ```

- **Quant finding (decisive — the gate underwrites pure sizing variance,
  now durably trended).** Live deployed pickle `n_train=3894`, gate
  active. The new ledger's first live row (smoke-tested on the real
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl`): **`MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL`**, MLP OOS
  rank-IC **+0.0876** vs raw `ml_score` **+0.141** (`ic_gap −0.0534`,
  `n=1571`, `gate_active=true`) — byte-identical to the
  `baseline_compare` CLI (the SSOT cross-check holding live). Four
  independent OOS arbiters agree on the same slice: `gate_pnl`
  **`GATE_RETURN_NEUTRAL`** (gate-on +0.38% vs gate-off +0.26%,
  equal-weight contribution **+0.11pp** — "pure added sizing variance"),
  `calibration --oos` **MISCALIBRATED** (spearman 0.088, decile err
  5.4pp, OOS decile-realized flat noise), `skill_trend`
  **`NEGATIVE_OOS_SKILL`** (recent median oos_rmse 11.30 ≥ fresh
  mean-predictor baseline 8.20, **trend DEGRADING**, `gate_active=1.0`).
  Fresh `scorer_skill_log` cycles 1–3 today corroborate the textbook
  overfit: `train_n` 3485→3870→3894 growing, `val_rmse ≪ oos_rmse`
  (9.0 vs 12.76), `oos_ic` {0.02, 0.02, −0.01}, `oos_dir_acc ≈ 0.50`.
  **Reported, not actioned** — turning the gate off / retraining is a
  training-dynamics change out of surgical scope (CLAUDE.md §6). The
  feature's contribution is making this decisive finding *durable and
  per-cycle trendable* for the first time, not changing the model.

- **Quant findings (corroborating, fresh live numbers).**
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` now **7858 rows** (BUY 5978 / SELL 1880),
  `forward_return_5d` mean +1.35 std 7.47, **0 non-finite rows** — the
  `_to_float` poison-row guard (load-bearing: one non-finite
  `forward_return_5d` wedges retraining indefinitely) is holding clean.
  **98.3% have `news_article_count = NULL`** → `news_urgency`/
  `news_article_count` pinned at their constant `build_features`
  defaults (the deep-history 1996–2018 windows pre-date
  `digital-intern/articles.db` coverage) — 2 of 17 inputs carry **zero
  training variance**, a concrete mechanism for the documented "the net
  destroys the signal it is fed". Backtest dispersion stays
  **leverage-beta, not skill**: same-recent-cycle run 6230
  +484.8%/vs_spy +396.7% beside run 6231 −49.4%/vs_spy −12.4% — the
  "best run" cycle line must never be read as strategy skill (the
  ledgers / permutation suite are the arbiters). 476 complete / 24
  failed runs; continuous loop process live, `continuous.log` fresh
  (mid-cycle), scorer retrains cleanly every cycle.

- **Operational (reconfirmed, out of scope).** Winner→ArticleNet
  feedback loop still **dead both ways**: `continuous.log` shows
  `[continuous] ml: inject err: database is locked after [4 attempts]`
  and `trainer timeout` / `trainer rc=-15` (digital-intern GPU +
  `articles.db` write-contention on the symlinked `/media` volume —
  matches passes #6–#16; the loop is **not** training ArticleNet on its
  winners; the scorer itself retrains cleanly). Exactly **one** Python
  traceback in the entire log — a transient
  `sqlite3.OperationalError: locking protocol` on `PRAGMA
  journal_mode=WAL` during a `BacktestStore()` init at *yesterday's*
  cycle-1 startup — and it is **correctly handled**: `main()`'s engine-
  init `try/except` caught it, logged `engine init failed … locking
  protocol`, slept 30s and continued; cycle 2 proceeded normally
  immediately after. Same symlinked-volume lock-contention class as the
  feedback-loop failure, not a code defect, not in this domain's
  surgical scope.

- **Concurrency note for the next agent.** This pass ran with ≥1 sibling
  agent active (a parallel `claude --model claude-opus-4-7` process
  observed in `ps`). The two changed files (`run_continuous_backtests.py`,
  `tests/test_continuous.py`) were path-scoped `git add`-ed (never
  `git add -A`), staged diff verified additions-only (`+280 / -0`, 2
  files), and the deliverable confirmed on `origin/master` **by content**
  (`git cat-file -e origin/master:<path>` + symbol grep), not by
  assuming it sits in this agent's commit message — the pass-#16
  shared-index-race lesson applied pre-emptively.

- **Run the ML/backtest suite (now 380 in the listed subset):** `cd
  /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest
  tests/test_decision_scorer.py tests/test_backtest.py

  baseline-ledger wiring lock.

## Review pass #17 — paper-trader CORE hybrid (2026-05-18)

**bugs_fixed = 1 · features_added = 1 · user_findings = 3.** Full suite is
not run end-to-end here (it times out >400s under concurrent sibling-agent
pytest load); a bounded representative sweep of every touched + adjacent
module is the evidence: **312 green** across `test_runner_heartbeat`,
`test_decision_context{,_endpoint}`, `test_sector_exposure{,_endpoint}`,
`test_core_runner`, `test_core_strategy`, `test_core_reporter`,
`test_decision_forensics`, `test_core_dashboard_helpers`.

- **Phase 1 — bug (`6cfcf46`, this agent's own clean commit).
  `analytics/decision_context.py` silently dropped the
  `sector_exposure_block`.** Commit `b471188` added `sector_exposure_block`
  to `strategy._build_payload` + wired it into the live `decide()` call but
  never updated `decision_context.py` — so `/api/decision-context` (and the
  CLI) reconstructed a prompt **missing the entire SECTOR EXPOSURE block**
  while its docstring still promised a string "byte-identical to the live
  prompt given identical inputs". A trader auditing *"did Opus see that
  this BUY piles onto an already-61%-semis book?"* got a false NO. **This
  is the exact `event_calendar`/`buying_power` regression class closed in
  pass #16, reintroduced one block later** — the recurring failure mode is
  "a new advisory block is threaded into `decide()`→`_build_payload` but
  the parallel `decision_context.assemble_inputs`/`build_decision_context`
  reconstruction is forgotten". `assemble_inputs` now builds
  `sector_exposure_block` exactly as `decide()` does (same read-only
  snapshot + lean `_names_in_play` set); `build_decision_context` threads
  it through `_build_payload` (which owns render order, so byte-fidelity is
  preserved) and reports it in `advisory_blocks` + the CLI summary. Locked
  by `tests/test_decision_context.py`
  (`TestNewAdvisoryBlocksReachPrompt::test_sector_exposure_block_reaches_prompt_verbatim_and_flagged`
  — verbatim text + flag + the exact `risk<sector<event<bp<WATCHLIST`
  ordering; `test_advisory_block_flags`/`…_omitted` updated to the
  now-7-key dict) and `tests/test_decision_context_endpoint.py`
  (`test_sector_exposure_block_reaches_reconstructed_prompt` — end-to-end
  via `assemble_inputs`). **Guidance for the next agent: any future
  `_build_payload` advisory block MUST be added to `decision_context.py`
  in the same commit — there is now a 3rd instance of this exact bug
  class; treat it as a standing checklist item.**

- **Phase 2 — feature. `runner_heartbeat` NO_DECISION-storm awareness so a
  brain-dead loop is no longer flat green** (this agent's code, swept into
  `4bd6610` by the auto-push daemon — muddied attribution, content verified
  on `origin/master` by symbol grep, the pass-#16 shared-index-race reality
  accepted not fought). `build_runner_heartbeat` measured only loop
  *cadence* (`now − last_decision_ts`); a loop cycling perfectly on
  schedule but emitting `NO_DECISION` every cycle — the documented live
  regime — reported `HEALTHY … restart_recommended:false`. The heartbeat
  is the surface a trader checks **first**, so it was actively reassuring
  them while the engine was wedged, suppressing the exact restart signal
  the runner's own auto-recovery breaker fires on. Additive overlay: the
  endpoint now passes `recent_actions` (`store.recent_decisions(20)`
  newest-first — the thesis_drift network/builder split); the builder
  computes a `decision_efficacy` sub-block (`PRODUCING`/`DEGRADED`/
  `IDLE_STORM`/`NO_DATA`) and on a genuine idle-storm
  (`>= NO_DECISION_STORM_THRESHOLD=5` consecutive — mirrors
  `runner.CONSECUTIVE_NO_DECISION_LIMIT`, drift-locked by test) folds it
  into the top-level `headline` + `restart_recommended`. **The liveness
  `verdict` enum is deliberately untouched** (the documented
  liveness/efficacy separation; every verdict-string lock stays green) and
  omitting `recent_actions` is **byte-identical** to before. The
  NO_DECISION predicate is a drift-locked verbatim mirror of the canonical
  `decision_forensics._is_no_decision` (invariant #10), inlined to keep
  this endpoint-path leaf import-cycle-free (the `OPEN_INTERVAL_S`
  precedent). 12 new tests in `tests/test_runner_heartbeat.py`.

- **Phase 3 — live findings (validated on the running `:8090` /
  pid-1819043 trader; both Phase-1 & Phase-2 changes confirmed *deployed*
  — git-watcher rebooted the runner onto the new SHA, `build-info`
  `stale:false`).**
  1. **Live IDLE_STORM, ongoing (HIGH).** `/api/runner-heartbeat`
     (now, via the Phase-2 feature) reports
     `decision_efficacy:IDLE_STORM consecutive_no_decision:17 (95% of
     last 20) restart_recommended:true` — and the last *FILLED* trade was
     `2026-05-17T09:38 BUY MU`, **>24h ago**, while the book is ~98%
     deployed in MU/LITE. Involuntary alpha bleed, real and current. Root
     cause is the documented host-load timeout storm (CLAUDE.md §11)
     **aggravated by git-watcher restart-thrash**: with N sibling agents
     committing every few minutes this session, the deferred-restart
     watcher bounces the runner repeatedly, and each restart abandons the
     in-flight Opus call mid-cycle. Not a code-fixable defect (host/ops
     lever) — but pass #17's Phase-2 is precisely what makes it *visible*
     instead of a lying green light.
  2. **Runner relaunch-and-refuse churn (MEDIUM, ops).** `logs/runner.log`
     shows ~49 `refusing to start a second trader` lines per 200 — the
     single-instance guard (invariant #19) is working **correctly** (exactly
     one trading pid 1819043 holds the flock; **no double-trade**), but a
     supervisor keeps attempting relaunches in the restart gaps. Confirms
     the pass-#16 "unsupervised / externally relaunched" ops state, still
     present. Reported, not fixed — touching the systemd unit / live
     process is out of scope and high-risk for a code pass.
  3. **Positive validation (LOW).** `/api/decision-context` now serves
     `advisory_blocks.sector_exposure:true` and `"SECTOR EXPOSURE"` is in
     the reconstructed prompt (7/7 blocks; the Phase-1 fix is live, proven
     via both the endpoint and the `__main__` CLI). All probed endpoints
     sub-100ms (`/` 0.035s, `/api/state` 0.004s, `/api/risk` 0.002s,
     `/api/sector-exposure` 0.002s, `/api/scorecard` 0.059s — SWR
     healthy); Discord delivery `notify:HEALTHY`. The data/dashboard layer
     is operationally sound; the system's real problem is finding #1.

- **Run the core suite (bounded, the full one times out under concurrent
  load):** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m
  pytest tests/test_runner_heartbeat.py tests/test_decision_context.py
  tests/test_decision_context_endpoint.py tests/test_sector_exposure.py

  tests/test_core_strategy.py tests/test_core_reporter.py
  tests/test_decision_forensics.py tests/test_core_dashboard_helpers.py -q`
  (312 green).

## Feature: decision-loss clock (feature-dev agent, 2026-05-18)

**Gap.** Every pass since #6 documents the same #1 unsolved problem —
NO_DECISION ~60% driven by `TIMEOUT_EMPTY` (the `claude` CLI starving
under host load when the hourly self-review + continuous-backtest loops
contend for the 3-subprocess OOM cap). It is exhaustively *measured*
(`decision_health`/`_forensics`/`_drought`/`_reliability`/
`capital_paralysis`) and AGENTS.md repeats "the lever is host load" —
but nothing told the operator **which clock hours to deconflict**.
`decision_forensics.hourly` is a sparse 24h *calendar* timeline: it shows
*today* spiked at 14:00, never that 14:00 spikes *every* day.

**What shipped.** Purely-additive extension of
`analytics/decision_forensics.py` — folds the **current-regime** decision
history onto a 24h UTC clock:

- New keys on `build_decision_forensics` (and the existing
  `/api/decision-forensics` route, no new endpoint): `regime_boundary`,
  `hour_of_day` (sparse 0–23, `{hour,total,failures,fail_pct}`),
  `hour_of_day_window_n/_failures`, `hour_of_day_min_sample`,
  `worst_hours` (top-3, min-sample-gated), `clock_hint` (actionable, only
  when a worst hour beats the window rate by ≥`CLOCK_HINT_MARGIN_PP`).
- `_regime_boundary()` derives `max(ts where classify_failure().tag ==
  'legacy')` from *this module's* own `classify_failure`/`_parse_ts` —
  the **identical regime contract** `decision_reliability` partitions on
  (no circular import; no touch to that contested file). Verified on the
  live DB: forensics `regime_boundary` == the live
  `/api/decision-reliability` boundary (`2026-05-15T17:42:42…`) —
  the clock and the reliability headline can never tell different
  stories. The legacy-inflated `hourly`/`by_market`/verdict are
  byte-unchanged (additive only; observational, never gates — invariants
  #2/#12).
- Dashboard: a 24h clock mini-chart + hint line added to the existing
  Decision-failure-forensics card (`#df-clock*`).
- **Live-validated** (Flask test client, the live DB): 133 current-regime
  cycles, recurring morning-UTC storm — 06:00 87% (n=8), 10:00 100%
  (n=7) vs 42% window-wide; 12:00–14:00/17:00/23:00 clean. The 11:00
  100%/n=2 bucket is correctly min-sample-suppressed.

**Tests.** New `tests/test_decision_loss_clock.py` (16, behaviour-
asserting incl. the regime-window property test + same-story parity vs
`build_decision_reliability`). Full suite green: 1690→1717 (0 failed;
baseline taken at HEAD before the change for concurrent-agent noise
isolation).

## Review pass #18 — paper-trader CORE hybrid (2026-05-18)

**bugs_fixed = 0 · features_added = 2 · user_findings = 4.** Bounded
representative sweep (the full suite times out >280s under concurrent
sibling-agent pytest load — the documented host state): **433 green**
across `test_core_reporter`, `test_runner_heartbeat{,_swr}`,
`test_core_state_swr`, `test_dashboard_threaded`, `test_core_runner{,_cycle}`,
`test_core_strategy`, `test_core_signals`, `test_core_store`,
`test_core_market`, `test_decision_forensics`,
`test_core_dashboard_helpers`. Two sibling ML+backtest agents and the
auto-push daemon were active; both feature commits were path-scoped
(`git add <file>`, never `-A`), staged-diff verified additions-only, and
confirmed on `origin/master` **by content** (`git show
origin/master:<path> | grep <symbol>`), not by commit attribution (the
pass #16/#17 shared-index-race lesson applied).

- **Phase 1 — no bug (honest `bugs_fixed = 0`).** A full read of
  `runner.py` / `reporter.py` / `signals.py` / `strategy.py` /
  `market.py` / `store.py` plus targeted `dashboard.py` probes found no
  genuine logic defect — consistent with 17 prior polished passes (pass
  #17 core found 1, a self-introduced regression; pass #17 ML found 0).
  Per the Phase-1 commit guard, no Phase-1 commit was made. Manufacturing
  a cosmetic "fix" to pad the counter was explicitly declined.

- **Phase 2 — feature 1 (`b7e0b5c`). `reporter._heartbeat_line` —
  runner-heartbeat verdict in the hourly/daily Discord summary.** Pass #17
  made a host-load NO_DECISION storm visible on `/api/runner-heartbeat`
  (the *dashboard*), but the operator **lives in Discord** and the
  hourly/daily summary still looked flat-green while the engine was wedged
  (the live 2026-05-18 state: 19/20 cycles NO_DECISION,
  `restart_recommended:true`). `send_quota_alert` covers only the
  *distinct* quota-exhaustion freeze (a specific `quota_exhausted` flag);
  a host-load idle storm had **no Discord surface at all**. The new line
  composes `build_runner_heartbeat` **verbatim** (single source of truth,
  invariant #10 — same `store.recent_decisions(20)` read +
  `market.is_market_open` split the endpoint uses, so the Discord line and
  `/api/runner-heartbeat` can never tell different stories), appended to
  `send_hourly_summary` + `send_daily_close` right after
  `_singleton_lock_line`. Surfaces **only when actionable**
  (`restart_recommended` / STALLED / LAGGING liveness / DEGRADED
  efficacy) so a healthy deciding loop adds no hourly noise (the summary
  must not become its own lying green light); IDLE_STORM detail is already
  folded into the builder's top-level headline so only DEGRADED gets an
  additive `efficacy —` sub-line. Observational only, never gates, no caps
  (invariants #2/#12 — the `_capital_pulse_line`/`_singleton_lock_line`
  precedent); a builder/store fault drops the line, **never** the summary
  (the reporter "no block, never no summary" failure contract). Locked by
  `tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestHeartbeatLine` (11 tests: verbatim-
  headline + restart-prefix on IDLE_STORM/STALLED, LAGGING-without-prefix,
  DEGRADED efficacy sub-line, HEALTHY+PRODUCING suppressed, builder-raises
  → `""`, a **no-drift real-builder** lock on a real Store seeded with an
  18-deep NO_DECISION storm, and the hourly+daily integration +
  fault-still-sends contract).

- **Phase 2 — feature 2 (`784201f`). SWR-cache `/api/runner-heartbeat`.**
  The surface a trader checks *first*, polled every 60s by the dashboard
  JS, was the **last high-traffic core endpoint not behind `swr_cached`**
  (the invariant #7 gap `/api/state` closed). Measured **9.45s under load
  avg 23** (the documented host-load storm) versus ~1ms warm — a pure DB +
  module-global read with no network, so the latency is pure CPU
  starvation, exactly what SWR absorbs. `@swr_cached("runner-heartbeat",
  20.0)`: runner cadence is ≥1800s/3600s with ≥1.25x/2x verdict
  multipliers and IDLE_STORM needs ≥5 cycles × ≥1800s, so a ≤20s stale
  window can **never** flip the verdict; the dashboard thread is
  independent of the runner thread, so a dead runner still gets a fresh
  background recompute of `secs_since_last_decision` from the frozen
  `last_decision_ts` and correctly goes STALLED — **SWR never masks the
  death it detects**. Inert under pytest unless `_SWR_TEST_FORCE`, so the
  existing `tests/test_runner_heartbeat.py` endpoint tests stay green on
  the live path. Locked by `tests/test_runner_heartbeat_swr.py` (mirrors
  `test_core_state_swr.py`: cold full-verdict + honesty keys; warm hit
  serves the **stale alarming** payload after the storm cleared — the
  discriminating "not silently recomputed every poll" lock;
  pytest-inert-by-default isolation). Like every recent feature, **applies
  on the next paper-trader restart** — a stale `:8090` keeps the old
  uncached path until then (`/api/build-info` `stale`).

- **Phase 3 — live findings (running `:8090`, build-info `stale`,
  `behind:2`, boot `18b40ec`).**
  1. **Live IDLE_STORM, ~25h since last trade (HIGH, host/ops, not
     code-fixable).** `/api/runner-heartbeat` reports `verdict=HEALTHY
     restart_recommended=true decision_efficacy=IDLE_STORM
     consecutive_no_decision=19`; the last *FILLED* trade was
     `2026-05-17T09:38 BUY MU`, **>25h ago**, the book ~98% deployed
     (cash $18.49 / total $972.69) in MU/LITE and frozen. Documented
     host-load timeout storm aggravated by git-watcher restart-thrash
     (the runner pid bounced 1822266→1827108 within this session). **This
     pass's feature 1 is precisely what now makes this visible in Discord
     instead of a flat-green hourly summary; feature 2 keeps the
     diagnostic surface instant under the same load.**
  2. **Running process is 2 commits stale (MEDIUM, documented).**
     `build-info` `boot 18b40ec / head 784201f / stale:true / behind:2`;
     the live heartbeat curl returns `cached:null` (old uncached path) —
     proof both new features are on disk but **not yet live**; they
     activate on the next restart (the invariant #7/#11 "does not rescue
     a running process" pattern, flagged so the operator restarts to
     arm the Discord heartbeat line + endpoint SWR).
  3. **`GOOGU` & `METAU` are permanently delisted but still in
     `strategy.WATCHLIST` *and* the SYSTEM_PROMPT "LEVERAGE INSTRUMENTS
     AVAILABLE" list (LOW, data hygiene).** Recurring yfinance 404s every
     `market._DEAD_TTL` window clutter `runner.log`; `_mark_dead`
     suppresses re-fetch so there is **no functional harm**, but Opus is
     still told two dead names are tradeable. **Reported, not fixed** —
     the trading universe + its mirrored prompt text is a judgment call
     outside a surgical pass (a WATCHLIST-only edit that left the prompt
     inconsistent would be worse); flagged per the task's "otherwise
     just report it".
  4. **Singleton-guard relaunch churn continues (MEDIUM, ops,
     pre-existing).** A supervisor keeps relaunching in restart gaps;
     the invariant-#19 guard correctly refuses every duplicate (**no
     double-trade**, `singleton_lock:acquired degraded:false`). Pass #17
     finding #2, still present; out of code scope.
  - **Positive validation.** Dashboard/data layer operationally sound:
    every probed panel (`/api/state` 0.004s, `/api/risk` 0.001s,
    `/api/decision-health` 0.012s, `/api/benchmark` 0.004s,
    `/api/capital-paralysis` 0.009s) HTTP 200 sub-13ms; Discord delivery
    `notify:HEALTHY` (0 consecutive failures, last OK recent) — the new
    heartbeat line WILL deliver on the next hourly. The system's only
    real problem is finding #1 (host load), not the code.

- **Run the core suite (bounded — the full one times out under concurrent
  load):** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m
  pytest tests/test_core_reporter.py tests/test_runner_heartbeat_swr.py
  tests/test_runner_heartbeat.py tests/test_core_state_swr.py
  tests/test_dashboard_threaded.py tests/test_core_runner.py
  tests/test_core_strategy.py tests/test_core_signals.py
  tests/test_core_store.py tests/test_core_market.py -q`.
  `TestHeartbeatLine` (reporter) + `TestRunnerHeartbeatSwr` are the new
  pass-#18 locks.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #18 (ML+backtest hybrid · gate-decision capture · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, commit guard
  explicitly permits).** Full re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`,
  `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus the newest, least-
  reviewed diagnostic modules (`baseline_trend.py`, `horizon_audit.py`,
  `gate_pnl.py`, `response_audit.py`, `corpus_audit.py`) and coupled
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` / `evaluate_scorer_oos`:
  the `_aligned` SELL `-forward_return` flip is applied to **both** probe
  and target uniformly in `horizon_audit._horizon_skill` (no spurious
  anti-correlation on the SELL subset); `baseline_trend` correctly
  excludes non-`ok`/null-`ic_gap` rows and never divides by zero on the
  small live slice (verified live: returns `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` on the
  *absent* `baseline_skill_log.jsonl`, no crash — the AGENTS.md claim
  holds); `_horizon_skill` drops non-finite/`nan` labels rather than
  zero-coercing them and guards `np.std==0` before `_spearman`;
  `_fwd_ret_h` gates on `price_on() is None` exactly like the byte-
  identical 5d path (no fabricated-zero asymmetry between the 5d and
  10d/20d windows); `split_outcomes_temporal` is deterministic and
  stable. Consistent with the documented 16+ prior no-new-bug
  ML/backtest passes. No test-hardening commit either — the Phase-1
  checklist items are already exact-value locked; a redundant test would
  be churn, not hardening (the pass-#17 precedent). ML/backtest
  regression 363/363 green before the feature, 372/372 after.

- **Feature shipped (commit `60b20d9`, `feat(continuous):`): the gate's
  ACTUAL then-deployed decision is now captured in
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl`.** `run_continuous_backtests.py::
  _parse_gate_decision` (pure/total/never-raises — the
  `_parse_scorer_status` discipline) + additive `gate_scorer_pred` /
  `gate_off_dist` keys in `_compute_decision_outcomes`. **The gap it
  fills:** `_compute_decision_outcomes` already parsed `score=` /
  `news_urg=` / `news_count=` out of each decision's reasoning but
  **discarded the gate's own `scorer=±X%` token** (and the
  `(off-dist,gate-skipped)` abstention marker `_ml_decide` emits). Every
  gate diagnostic (`gate_audit`, `gate_pnl`) therefore had to RE-predict
  with **today's** deployed pickle on the stored features — a
  counterfactual ("what would the current model say"), provably **not**
  what the gate did at decision time with that cycle's *own* model;
  `gate_pnl` itself documents the resulting reconstruction residual is
  explicitly *NOT in its verdict*. Capturing the true historical
  prediction + abstention makes the gate's realized effect *measurable*
  instead of reconstructed. **Zero training/gate/trade impact:**
  `train_scorer` reads ONLY `forward_return_5d`, so the new keys are
  inert — exactly the additive `forward_return_10d/20d` precedent (pass
  #18 multi-horizon). NOT a new diagnostic module (no treadmill); a
  data-fidelity fix to the existing outcomes pipeline. `None` on SELL
  rows (gate is BUY-only) and untrained/sub-gate cycles (no `scorer=`
  emitted). 9 exact-value locks + a 5d-byte-identity regression anchor
  in `tests/test_gate_decision_capture.py` (pure-helper matrix:
  in-dist / off-dist / `+0.0%` boundary / untrained / SELL /
  `score=`-vs-`scorer=` disambiguation / garbage-never-raises; +
  end-to-end through `_compute_decision_outcomes` proving the keys land
  and `forward_return_5d` is unperturbed). **Applies on next
  `run_continuous_backtests.py` restart** — the running loop predates it
  (the documented deploy-stale pattern; ledger lives at the gitignored
  `data/decision_outcomes.jsonl`).
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_gate_decision_capture.py -v
  ```

- **Quant finding (decisive, reconfirmed fresh — the gate underwrites
  pure sizing variance).** Live deployed pickle `n_train=3860`, gate
  active. **Five independent OOS arbiters agree on the same temporal-OOS
  slice:** `baseline_compare` = **`MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL`** (MLP
  rank_ic **+0.069** vs raw `ml_score` one-liner **+0.111**, ic_gap
  −0.042 — the net carries *less* OOS rank skill than feature slot 0
  alone); `calibration --oos` = in-sample **`WELL_CALIBRATED`** (spearman
  0.458, decile err 2.30pp) collapsing to OOS **`MISCALIBRATED`**
  (spearman **0.069**, decile err **8.67pp** — the tool prints its own
  optimism-gap warning); `skill_trend` = **`NEGATIVE_OOS_SKILL`**
  (oos_rmse **11.30** ≥ fresh mean-predictor baseline **9.51**, median
  oos_ic 0.04, trend STABLE, `gate_active=1.0`); `gate_pnl` =
  **`GATE_RETURN_NEUTRAL`** (gate-on +0.76% vs gate-off +0.58%,
  equal-weight contribution **+0.18pp**, within ±1.0pp — "reallocates
  capital with no net realized effect: pure added sizing variance");
  `scorer_skill_log.jsonl` last cycles `oos_ic ∈ {0.01,0.19,0.02,0.02,
  −0.01,0.07}`, `oos_dir_acc ≈ 0.50`, `val_rmse ≈9 ≪ oos_rmse ≈10–17`
  (textbook overfit). The conviction gate (invariant #5, active every
  cycle) sizes real backtest positions on a 17-feature net with
  demonstrably zero/negative OOS skill. **Reported, not actioned** —
  turning the gate off / retraining is a training-dynamics change out of
  surgical scope (CLAUDE.md §6); the contribution of this pass is making
  the gate's *actual* historical decision durably measurable for the
  first time, not changing the model.

- **Quant findings (corroborating).** (1) **Running loop is stale code**
  — PID `1734916` predates the pass-#17 baseline-ledger commit
  (`6ade72d`), the pass-#18 multi-horizon capture, AND this pass's
  gate-decision capture: `data/baseline_skill_log.jsonl` does **not
  exist**, live `decision_outcomes.jsonl` rows carry only the 17 base
  keys (no `forward_return_10d/20d` / `gate_scorer_pred`). All three
  durability features are inert until the operator restarts
  `run_continuous_backtests.py` — the documented deploy-stale
  operational state, **not a code bug** (`baseline_trend` correctly
  returns `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`). (2) **Winner→ArticleNet feedback loop
  dead both ways** — 48 `inject err: database locked after 4 attempts` /
  `trainer timeout` / `trainer rc=` lines in the last 4000 log lines
  (digital-intern GPU + `articles.db` write-contention on the symlinked
  volume — matches passes #6–#17; the scorer itself retrains cleanly
  every cycle). (3) **Backtest dispersion is pure leverage-beta** — same
  recent batch: run 6230 +484.8%/vs_spy +396.7% beside run 6231
  −49.4%/vs_spy −12.4%; 476 complete / 24 failed, **no NaN**, max
  complete run_id 6234 (last completed 10:35 UTC — the loop is
  progressing). The "best run" cycle line must never be read as strategy
  skill. All reported observations, out of surgical scope.

- **Concurrency note.** This pass ran with **3 sibling agents executing
  the identical task prompt concurrently** (`ps`: PIDs 1752314 / 1824143
  / 1839361, same `claude --model claude-opus-4-7` HYBRID prompt) plus a
  swarm of dirty `../digital-intern/` working-tree files. **Never
  `git add -A`.** The two changed files (`run_continuous_backtests.py`
  with verified 0 sibling tokens, new exclusively-mine
  `tests/test_gate_decision_capture.py`) were path-scoped `git add`-ed,
  staged diff verified additions-only (`+224/-0`, 2 files, 0
  sibling-token grep hits), the index committed (NO pathspec — the
  pass-#16 `git commit -- <path>` re-snapshot lesson applied
  pre-emptively), and the deliverable confirmed on `origin/master` **by
  content** (`git cat-file -e origin/master:<test>` +
  `_parse_gate_decision` symbol grep), not by assuming it sits in this
  agent's commit message.

- **Run the ML/backtest suite:** `cd
  /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest
  tests/ -q -k "ml or backtest or scorer or calibration or continuous or
  horizon"`. `tests/test_gate_decision_capture.py` holds the new
  gate-decision-capture locks; it has none of "ml"/"backtest"/"scorer"
  in its node ids — add it explicitly like `test_calibration.py` /
  `test_horizon_audit.py` (it is picked up by the `continuous` keyword
  via `_compute_decision_outcomes`, but list it for clarity).

## Feature: macro calendar — forward FOMC rate-decision awareness (feature-dev agent, 2026-05-18)

**Gap.** Across 47 analytics modules the live Opus decision prompt had
exactly **one** forward-looking block: `event_calendar` (single-name
**earnings**). **Zero** macro-event awareness existed anywhere — yet this
watchlist is leveraged-ETF heavy (SOXL/TQQQ/NVDL/SOXS), exactly the
instruments that gap hardest on a Fed surprise, and the system's own 5h
Opus briefings repeatedly *lead* with macro (bond rout, 10Y, FOMC). A
leveraged book entering the rate-decision instant blind is the macro
analog of the exact "added the day before an earnings print, blind"
mistake `event_calendar` was built to close — the same gap, one dimension
over.

**What shipped.** New `paper_trader/analytics/macro_calendar.py` —
`build_macro_calendar(now=None, horizon_days=14.0)`:

- **FOMC-only, by verifiability discipline.** The 2026 FOMC schedule is
  fully verified from federalreserve.gov (all 8 meetings, fetched
  2026-05-18). BLS CPI/Employment-Situation forward dates are *not*
  reliably verifiable (bls.gov hard-blocks every fetch HTTP 403;
  archive-URL dates conflict with summaries by ±2d; Jul–Dec unreleased).
  Encoding an unverified date on the live decision path would mislead Opus
  — declined. CPI/NFP are a documented future extension *pending a
  verifiable source*, NOT an oversight (a parallel table behind the same
  honesty bound).
- **Pure static table + date math** — NO file I/O, NO network, no import
  beyond stdlib (even safer than `event_calendar`'s disk read; the
  `risk_mirror` hot-path discipline). `now` injectable, deterministic,
  `_safe` (never raises — a top-level guard returns an honest dict).
- **Honesty bound (landmine guard).** `SCHEDULE_VALID_THROUGH` is exactly
  the last encoded instant; `now` past it degrades to one honest
  "schedule not loaded" line — never a fabricated event. Locked by a
  table↔bound **no-drift** test (extending one without the other fails
  RED) — the test written first.
- **Time-precision tiers** (the material differentiator vs
  `event_calendar`'s date-only granularity): `IMMINENT_HOURS` (<24h,
  rendered "in Xh") > `IMMINENT` (≤3d) > `UPCOMING` (≤horizon). Each FOMC
  statement instant is the 2nd-day 14:00 ET policy release, ET→UTC
  resolved across the 2026 DST boundary (Jan/Dec 19:00Z EST, Mar–Oct
  18:00Z EDT) so there is no tz-library dependency on the hot path.
- **Market-wide, not per-ticker** (the structural difference from
  `event_calendar`): no positions/names arg — an FOMC decision is
  relevant to a flat book too; always rendered.
- **Observational, never prescriptive** (invariants #2/#12 — the
  `event_calendar` contract): autonomy-preserving preamble, no directive
  verb, no cap, never gates Opus.

**Wiring (all one commit — the standing checklist item).**
`strategy._build_payload` gained a `macro_calendar_block` kwarg rendered
**between `event_calendar` and `buying_power`** (forward blocks stay
adjacent: earnings then macro) — the prompt order is now
`risk < sector < event < macro < bp < WATCHLIST PRICES`. `strategy.decide()`
builds it `_safe` after `event_calendar_block`. Per the AGENTS.md pass-#17
standing checklist item (3rd documented instance of "a new `_build_payload`
advisory block forgotten in `decision_context.py`"), **the same commit**
threads it through `decision_context.build_decision_context` +
`assemble_inputs` + the `advisory_blocks` dict + the `__main__` CLI line.
New endpoint **`GET /api/macro-calendar`** serves the same builder
(prompt↔endpoint parity — the `event_calendar`/`risk_mirror` discipline);
pure static-table, no store read.

**Tests.** New `tests/test_macro_calendar.py` (18, behaviour-asserting):
honesty-bound degrade (written first) + table↔bound no-drift; the 8
encoded instants == the federalreserve.gov-verified 2026 set; ET→UTC DST
correctness; IMMINENT_HOURS/IMMINENT/UPCOMING + exact 24h/3d/horizon
boundaries; past-event grace; soonest-first sort; observational/no-directive;
never-raises; `_build_payload` render position + None-renders-nothing;
`/api/macro-calendar` Flask parity. Plus `test_decision_context.py`
(updated exact `advisory_blocks` dict + new
`test_macro_calendar_block_reaches_prompt_verbatim_and_flagged` —
the full `risk<sector<event<macro<bp<WATCHLIST` ordering lock) and
`test_decision_context_endpoint.py` (assemble_inputs-builds-it discriminating
lock). Bounded sweep **330 green** across `test_macro_calendar`,
`test_decision_context{,_endpoint}`, `test_event_calendar`,
`test_core_strategy`, `test_buying_power`, `test_sector_exposure`,
`test_core_dashboard_helpers`, `test_core_runner`, `test_core_reporter`,
`test_core_state_swr`, `test_dashboard_threaded` (the full suite times out
>400s under concurrent sibling-agent load — the documented host state).

Like every recent feature this **applies on the next paper-trader restart**
— the live `:8090` is `stale` / `behind:2`, so it keeps the old prompt
(no macro block) until the runner reboots onto the new SHA.

## Review pass #19 — paper-trader CORE hybrid (2026-05-18)

**bugs_fixed = 1 · features_added = 2 · user_findings = 4.** Bounded
representative sweep (the full suite times out under concurrent
sibling-agent + auto-commit-daemon load — the documented host state):
**503 green** across `test_core_{reporter,store,strategy,runner,runner_cycle,market,signals,dashboard_helpers}`,
`test_market_negcache`, `test_capital_paralysis{,_swr}`, `test_benchmark`,
`test_runner_heartbeat{,_swr}`, `test_core_state_swr`,
`test_dashboard_threaded`, `test_ml_live_opinion`, `test_parse_retry`,
`test_quota_guard`. Three+ sibling agents and the auto-push daemon were
active; commits were path-scoped (`git add <file>`, never `-A`),
staged-diff verified, and pushed fast-forward onto `origin/master`.

- **Phase 1 — bug (`b92b9c2`). `Store.get_portfolio()` only absorbed the
  `row is None` shared-connection corruption mode; the *equally documented*
  "row whose columns read back NULL" mode fell straight through.** The
  function's own docstring promised to absorb **both** modes (28x
  `/api/state` 500s over 2 days), but the code self-healed only `row is
  None`. A transient NULL `cash`/`total_value` was returned verbatim and
  then hit `strategy._portfolio_snapshot` as `None + open_value` — a
  `TypeError` that **aborts the entire `decide()` cycle** (no decision
  row, no equity point) until the next clean read, on top of 500ing
  `/api/state`. Fix: the self-heal guard now also fires on
  `row["cash"] is None or row["total_value"] is None`, routing through the
  same `_init_portfolio()`+re-read path — which recovers the real
  well-formed values on a transient corrupt read and never resets a live
  book (`_init_portfolio` only INSERTs a *missing* row). Existing
  resilience tests unchanged (no regression); 2 new
  `tests/test_core_store.py::TestGetPortfolioResilience` tests cover
  transient-recovery and persistent-degrade-arithmetic-safe. Distinct
  from the sibling's `05b406e` (cursor-collision `fetchone()==None`
  retry) — a different corruption mode on the same shared connection.

- **Phase 2 — feature 1 (`9bfbbf8`). SWR-cache `/api/risk`,
  `/api/benchmark`, `/api/capital-paralysis`, `/api/decision-health`.**
  Live probing (fresh runner = cold caches, host load avg ~16–23) found
  these four were the only remaining high-traffic **pure-store-read**
  core panels not behind `swr_cached`: each ran its heavy multi-read
  handler (`recent_trades(2000)` / `equity_curve(5000)` /
  `recent_decisions(3000)`) inline with no bounded cold path and **hung
  >15s (curl → 000)** under CPU starvation, while every already-cached
  endpoint served a fast `{"warming":true}` placeholder. Four core trader
  panels ("am I beating the index?", "why is my book stuck?") were
  effectively dead under load. All four verified pure store reads (no
  market/yfinance/network) — the latency is pure lock-contention, exactly
  what SWR absorbs (the pass-#18 runner-heartbeat precedent, invariant
  #7). `@swr_cached(.., 30.0)`: 30s ≪ the ≥1800s decision cadence so a
  ≤30s stale window can never flip a verdict. SWR is pytest-inert unless
  `_SWR_TEST_FORCE`, so the existing exact-value
  `test_capital_paralysis.py` / `test_benchmark.py` stay green. Locked by
  `tests/test_capital_paralysis_swr.py` (cold full-payload+honesty-keys,
  warm-served-stale, pytest-inert-default — mirrors
  `test_core_state_swr.py`). **Applies on the next paper-trader restart.**

- **Phase 2 — feature 2 (`2e8c60e`). `reporter._fmt_trade_stamp` — date +
  relative age on stale hourly recent-trades.** The hourly summary
  rendered every recent trade as a bare `HH:MM` (UTC) with no date; the
  desk's #1 documented pathology is a book frozen for many hours that
  still *looks* active — a 25h-old `BUY MU` shown as `[09:38]` reads as
  today's fill (the "unclear" the trader persona is frustrated by).
  Today's trades stay byte-identical `HH:MM`; older ones render
  `MM-DD HH:MM · Nd ago` so staleness is unmissable. Pure,
  now-injectable; future-skew guarded; a corrupt timestamp degrades to a
  clean `??:??` sentinel (the reporter additive-line contract — never
  raises). Locked by `tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestAgo` +
  `TestFmtTradeStamp` (bucket boundaries, today/stale/future/naive/corrupt,
  hourly-integration on a frozen clock).

- **Phase 3 finding-fix (`dbcc6e6`, folded into a `fix:` — NOT counted as
  a bug).** Resolved AGENTS.md review-pass-#18 core finding #3:
  permanently-delisted **GOOGU / METAU** removed from `strategy.WATCHLIST`
  *and* the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` "LEVERAGE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE" text (verified
  live: yfinance 404 / no quote, vs NVDU/MSFU/AMZU still trading). They
  could never fill (`market.get_price` → None → `_execute` BLOCKS) and
  re-404'd `runner.log` every `_DEAD_TTL` window. The code change merged
  via the repo's auto-commit daemon; `dbcc6e6` adds the missing regression
  lock (`test_core_strategy.py::TestWatchlistHygiene`) so neither the
  universe nor the mirrored prompt text can silently re-introduce a
  delisted name (the recurring "fix one place, not the other" concern).
  **Live side only** — `backtest.py`'s historical universe is the
  ML-domain owner's call, deliberately untouched.

- **Phase 3 — live findings (running `:8090`, build-info cycled
  `b92b9c2`→`548437a` during the session via relaunch churn).**
  1. **Dashboard `:8090` transiently unreachable during singleton-guard
     relaunch churn (MEDIUM, ops, pass-#18 finding #4 recurring).** A
     supervisor keeps relaunching `runner.py` in restart gaps; the
     invariant-#19 guard correctly refuses duplicates (no double-trade)
     but `:8090` is dead for the ~10–30s relaunch window (observed:
     curl exit 7 at ~04:13, 200 again seconds later on the fresh PID).
     Out of code scope.
  2. **A rogue/generic concurrent agent is committing to the shared repo
     (MEDIUM, ops).** PID 1845436 runs an outdated prompt referencing
     non-existent `paper_trader/scorer.py` / `trader.py` and targeting the
     `/home/zeph/paper-trader` symlink, with "Commit and push" — opaque
     pushes onto the same `master`. Combined with the auto-commit daemon
     that swept this pass's `strategy.py` change into a generic
     `feature(pt)` commit, scoped-commit attribution is unreliable; verify
     by **content** on `origin/master`, not by commit message.
  3. **Book still capital-paralysed (HIGH, host/ops, not code-fixable).**
     `/api/state`: cash $18.49 / total $972.69, ~98% deployed in MU/LITE,
     MU P/L $0.00 (stale-mark flat), no new fill since
     `2026-05-17T09:38 BUY MU`. The documented #1 pathology persists; this
     pass's feature 2 is precisely what now makes that staleness visible
     in the Discord hourly instead of a dateless `[09:38]`.
  4. **`/api/runner-heartbeat` returns all-None `{"warming":true}
     cached:false` on a cold call under load (LOW, expected SWR
     behaviour).** The check-first panel is uninformative for the first
     ~budget seconds after a relaunch — exactly when a trader most wants
     it. Inherent to the cold-start gap (no stale copy yet); the SWR-4
     feature does not change this (heartbeat was already cached). Noted,
     not fixed — a cold-start prewarm is a larger design question.
  - **Positive validation.** `/api/state` 0.004s, `/api/feed-health` /
    `/api/source-edge` 200 in ~2s (SWR cold budget honoured); after the
    SWR-4 fix the four previously-hung panels inherit the same bounded
    cold path. Phase-1 store fix + 503-green bounded sweep confirm the
    decision loop's portfolio read is no longer a `None`-propagation
    abort risk.

- **Run the core suite (bounded — the full one times out under concurrent
  load):** `python3 -m
  pytest tests/test_core_store.py tests/test_core_reporter.py
  tests/test_core_strategy.py tests/test_capital_paralysis_swr.py
  tests/test_core_state_swr.py tests/test_runner_heartbeat_swr.py -q`.
  `TestGetPortfolioResilience` (store), `TestWatchlistHygiene` (strategy),
  `TestAgo`/`TestFmtTradeStamp` (reporter) and
  `TestCapitalParalysisSwr` are the new pass-#19 locks.

## Review pass #20 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-18)

Repo HEAD cycled `b387414`→`542446d`→`d888261` during the session (this
pass's two commits, plus auto-commit-daemon / concurrent-agent churn — at
least three other `claude --model claude-opus-4-7` review agents were live
on the same tree; verify attribution by **content** on `origin/master`, not
by message — the recurring pass-#18/#19 concern).

- **Phase 1 — bug fixed (1): `_swr_prewarm` omitted 6 of 22 `@swr_cached`
  endpoints (`542446d`).** `dashboard._swr_prewarm`'s docstring promises it
  pre-builds *"every slow SWR cache once at boot"*, but its `targets` list
  carried only 16 of the 22 `@swr_cached` endpoints. The 6 omitted —
  `risk`, `benchmark`, `capital-paralysis`, `decision-health`,
  `runner-heartbeat`, `scorer-confidence` (the first four SWR-wrapped in the
  immediately-prior commit `9bfbbf8`) — alone paid the full cold path after
  **every** restart: a bounded stall then `{"warming": true}`, real data
  only on the frontend's next auto-refresh poll. Five of them are precisely
  the panels a trader opens FIRST to triage "why is the bot frozen?", so the
  freeze-triage surface was the last to populate — **this directly resolves
  pass-#19 Phase-3 finding #4**, which observed exactly this on
  `/api/runner-heartbeat` and explicitly deferred it ("Noted, not fixed — a
  cold-start prewarm is a larger design question"). Fix adds the 6 tuples +
  `tests/test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py`, a regression-lock asserting the
  prewarm list stays `== {@swr_cached names}` so a future SWR-wrapped
  endpoint can never silently re-rot the contract. Confirmed empirically
  before/after: `/api/risk` & `/api/runner-heartbeat` resolve on the 2nd
  poll; all 22 are now prewarmed.

- **Phase 2 — feature added (1): `/api/equity-integrity` — time-series P&L
  trust audit (`d888261`).** `mark_integrity` answers "is my book stale
  RIGHT NOW" (point-in-time). Nothing audited the recorded `equity_curve`
  *over time*, yet `/api/drawdown`, `/api/benchmark`, `/api/analytics`
  Sharpe and the hourly Discord P/L line are all derived from it — a silent
  corruption there poisons every P&L surface with nothing saying so. New
  pure builder `paper_trader/analytics/equity_integrity.py` +
  `equity_integrity_api` (EOF, lowest-collision insertion point) flags:
  **NEGATIVE_CASH** (the no-hard-cap book physically over-drawing —
  AGENTS.md #12), **NONPOSITIVE_EQUITY**, and **SUSPECT** no-trade jumps
  (|Δtotal|≥8% with no trade in the window — the mismark / stale-price
  unfreeze / option-settlement signature; a jump *with* a trade in-window is
  explained away). Pure store reads only (no network → no SWR wrap needed);
  advisory/read-only, gates nothing, adds no caps (the `mark_integrity`
  contract). 10 tests assert exact verdicts/values incl. the half-open
  `(lo, hi]` window boundary and the never-raises-on-garbage degrade.
  Verified live: **CLEAN across 787 points, min cash $2.61** — confirms the
  no-cap book has never over-drawn and the P&L history is trustworthy.

- **Phase 3 — live findings (running `:8090`, runner orphan PID 1866235
  on current code).**
  1. **Runner is an UNSUPERVISED ORPHAN (HIGH, ops, not code-fixable).**
     `journalctl --user -u paper-trader`: the systemd unit *failed* at
     01:46 (`status=1/FAILURE`, the invariant-#19 guard correctly refused
     to start while an older manual launch held the lock) and stayed
     **inactive/disabled**. The live trader is a bare `python3 runner.py`
     with PPID 1. `/api/supervision` correctly returns
     `verdict=UNSUPERVISED orphan=True`. The git-watcher's whole
     deferred-restart/deadman design relies on `systemd Restart=always`;
     with the unit down, the **next** git-watcher restart or deadman
     `os._exit(0)` (and commits keep landing, so it *will* fire) leaves the
     trader permanently DOWN. Operator action: `systemctl --user enable
     --now paper-trader` once the orphan is stopped.
  2. **Live trader frozen — IDLE_STORM (HIGH, host-saturation, not a
     code/prompt bug).** 60% lifetime `NO_DECISION` (473/785); the current
     ongoing `PARALYSIS` drought is 24.9h / 73 cycles / 53 `NO_DECISION`
     (`/api/decision-drought`). Last real fill `2026-05-17T09:38 BUY MU`
     (>26h ago). `/api/runner-heartbeat`: liveness `HEALTHY` but
     `decision_efficacy=IDLE_STORM`, `restart_recommended=true` (the
     instrumentation is correct). Root cause is the documented host
     starvation: load avg 13–21, ~356 MB free RAM, with 4+ concurrent
     `claude --model claude-opus-4-7` review agents **plus**
     `run_continuous_backtests.py` — every live Opus decision call times
     out (`claude returned no response (timeout/empty)`). The review
     harness induces the very freeze it observes.
  3. **Discord delivery seen failing `env: 'node': No such file`
     (MEDIUM).** `logs/runner.log` (stale, from the 01:46 failed systemd
     attempts) shows the documented openclaw shebang/PATH outage —
     operator's primary surface was dark for those attempts. `reporter._send`
     already has the `bin_dir`-onto-PATH fix; the current orphan is on
     patched code, but Discord health for the orphan could not be confirmed
     (it logs to a detached stdout; the unit journal is empty). Watch
     `notify_health.restart_recommended`.
  4. **Capital paralysis persists (HIGH, host/ops, correctly surfaced).**
     `/api/state` cash $18.49 / total $972.69 (~98% deployed); LITE held
     3.7d at **7.0× the empirical median losing hold**, −$6.21 disposition
     drag (`/api/hold-discipline`). Documented #1 pathology; instrumentation
     (`hold-discipline`, `capital-paralysis`, the Discord `_capital_pulse_
     line`) all fire correctly — nothing to fix in code.
  5. **`/api/position-thesis` not SWR-wrapped, intermittently slow (LOW).**
     One probe 200 in 1.56s, an earlier one >12s under the load spike. Not
     consistently broken; a candidate for the same `swr_cached` treatment
     the other slow endpoints got. Noted, not fixed (collision risk with
     concurrent agents; marginal under current load).

- **Run the touched/adjacent locks (bounded — the full suite is ~25 min and
  load-flakes `test_dashboard_threaded::test_threaded_server_parallelizes`,
  a pure timing assertion, under load avg >10):** `python3 -m pytest
  tests/test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py tests/test_equity_integrity.py
  tests/test_dashboard_swr.py tests/test_mark_integrity.py
  tests/test_core_dashboard_helpers.py -q`. The pass-#20 locks are
  `test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py` (prewarm == @swr_cached set, the
  regression-lock for the fix) and `test_equity_integrity.py` (exact-value
  verdicts incl. the half-open window boundary).

### 2026-05-18 review pass #19 (ML+backtest hybrid · anti-overfit scorer config · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, the commit
  guard explicitly permits it).** Full re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`,
  `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus the newest
  least-reviewed `baseline_trend.py`: `_inject_and_train`'s 11-col INSERT
  matches its 11-tuple and the `for…else` lock-retry returns the honest
  error after exhausting `_LOCK_RETRY_SLEEPS`; `_ml_decide`'s
  `scorer_off_dist` gate-skip + `getattr(_scorer,"_n_train",0)` dummy
  fallback are sound; `_fwd_ret_h` gates on `price_on() is None` exactly
  like the byte-identical 5d path; `PriceCache._build_trading_days`
  empty-SPY fallback is paired with the honest `benchmark_unavailable`
  note. Consistent with the documented 17 prior no-new-bug ML/backtest
  passes (#5–#18) — the core trio is exhaustively exact-value locked. No
  redundant test-hardening commit (the pass-#17/#18 churn-avoidance
  precedent). ML/backtest regression **368 green before** the feature.

- **Feature shipped (Phase 2, `feat(ml):`): the DecisionScorer MLP is now
  regularized — `(32,16)` + L2 `alpha=1e-2` + `early_stopping` (was an
  unregularized `(64,32,16)`/600-iter net).** `paper_trader/ml/
  decision_scorer.py::train_scorer`, the exact location CLAUDE.md §12
  points to ("Train the DecisionScorer differently") and explicitly **in
  scope** (it is not the gate-threshold change CLAUDE.md §6 marks
  out-of-scope). **The gap it closes:** the per-cycle
  `scorer_skill_log.jsonl` records the overfit every cycle
  (`val_rmse ≈ 9–11 ≪ oos_rmse ≈ 12–17`) and this pass's fresh read
  reconfirmed it (cyc4 `val 10.74 / oos 16.68`, cyc5 `9.01 / 14.04`). A
  faithful A/B replaying `train_scorer`'s exact preprocessing on the
  **live** `decision_outcomes.jsonl` 5000-row tail under
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal(0.2)` (the honest holdout
  `_train_decision_scorer` itself uses), across **4 MLP seeds**, showed
  the new config uniformly lowers temporal-OOS RMSE (**mean ≈14.97→≈12.58,
  up to 16.68→10.46** on the worst prior seed), closes the val/oos gap
  from ~6pp to **<1pp**, and leaves OOS rank-IC / dir-acc within ±0.04 /
  coin-flip noise. **Honest scope:** this removes the *magnitude* overfit;
  it does **not** create rank skill — the MLP stays
  `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL` (a deeper data-signal limitation, unchanged
  by hyperparameters, still tracked by the baseline ledger / pass #18).
  The `_ml_decide` conviction gate acts on the prediction's MAGNITUDE
  bucket (±10/±5/0), so a uniformly lower-error, less-extrapolating head
  makes those bucket assignments materially less noisy. **Zero schema
  impact:** gate arms, the `±PRED_CLAMP_PCT` clamp, `build_features`,
  `SECTORS`, `N_FEATURES`, the `{model,scaler,n_train}` pickle, and the
  numpy-lstsq sklearn-absent fallback are all untouched — a drop-in the
  next retrain cycle picks up. Realigns the code with CLAUDE.md §3's
  long-documented "MLPRegressor 32→16" architecture (the code had
  silently drifted to `(64,32,16)`). 2 behaviour-asserting locks in
  `tests/test_decision_scorer.py::TestAntiOverfitConfig`: a config-lock
  (pickled `hidden_layer_sizes==(32,16)`, `alpha==1e-2`,
  `early_stopping`, `validation_fraction==0.15`, `n_iter_no_change==25`)
  and a **discriminating** noise-memorization test — on a pure-noise
  target the regularized net's `pred_std/target_std` ratio is **≈0.40**
  vs the old config's measured **≈1.00** (memorizes noise almost
  perfectly), asserted `< 0.65` with wide both-sided margin so it is
  non-flaky AND fails RED on a revert to the memorizing net. **370 green
  after** (368 + 2). **Applies on the next `run_continuous_backtests.py`
  restart** — the running loop (PID predates this) keeps the old config
  until the operator reboots it (the documented deploy-stale pattern;
  pickle at the gitignored `data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl`).
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_decision_scorer.py::TestAntiOverfitConfig -v
  ```

- **Quant findings (Phase 3, live).** (1) **Overfit reconfirmed fresh and
  now actioned** — `scorer_skill_log.jsonl` last cycles all show
  `val_rmse ≪ oos_rmse`, `oos_ic ≈ 0`, `oos_dir_acc ≈ 0.49–0.56`; the
  shipped config is the first pass to *act* on it rather than only
  re-measure it. (2) **Zero OOS rank skill persists** —
  `oos_ic ∈ {0.19,0.02,0.02,−0.01,0.07,0.04}`; the MLP carries no durable
  rank edge over the raw `ml_score` one-liner (data-signal limitation, out
  of surgical scope, unchanged by this pass). (3) **Running loop is stale
  code** — the live `decision_outcomes.jsonl` tail rows carry only the 17
  base keys (no `forward_return_10d/20d`, no `gate_scorer_pred`), and this
  config change is likewise inert until restart; documented deploy-stale
  operational state, not a code bug. (4) **Backtest dispersion is pure
  leverage-beta** — run 6230 +484.8%/vs_spy +396.7% beside run 6231
  −49.4%/vs_spy −12.4% same recent batch; **477 complete / 24 failed, no
  NaN**, max completed run_id 6235 at 11:46 UTC (loop healthy and
  progressing). The "best run +N%" cycle line must never be read as
  strategy skill. The only `continuous.log` "errors" are external GDELT
  rate-limit/connection-reset noise (handled by the retry+backoff+
  permanent-cache path) and the documented winner→ArticleNet
  `database locked`/`trainer timeout` contention — no core-code traceback.
  Findings 2–4 reported, out of surgical scope.

- **Concurrency note.** Ran with **3+ sibling agents on the identical
  task** in the shared monorepo working tree (core-hybrid siblings
  committed their own `pass #19`/`#20` to `AGENTS.md` mid-pass) plus a
  swarm of dirty `../digital-intern/` + sibling-untracked
  `paper_trader/ml/gate_pnl.py` / `analytics/game_plan.py` files. **Never
  `git add -A`.** Exactly three path-scoped files staged
  (`paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py`, `tests/test_decision_scorer.py`,
  `AGENTS.md`), `git diff --staged` verified additions-only with zero
  sibling-token hits, committed via the index (no pathspec — the pass-#16
  re-snapshot lesson), deliverable confirmed on `origin/master` by content.

- **Run the ML/backtest suite:** `cd
  /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest
  tests/ -q -k "ml or backtest or scorer or calibration or continuous or
  horizon"` (370 green; `TestAntiOverfitConfig` is picked up by the
  `scorer` keyword).

## Review pass #21 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-18)

Repo HEAD at boot `5a0af2d`; this pass's single commit is `b0ac368`. Ran
alongside ≥1 live sibling `claude --model claude-opus-4-7` ML/backtest
agent (PID 1752314 on the identical task, ML files) — verify attribution
by **content** on `origin/master`, not message. **bugs_fixed = 0 ·
features_added = 1 · user_findings = 5.**

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, the commit
  guard explicitly permits it).** Full re-trace of `runner.py`,
  `reporter.py`, `signals.py`, `strategy.py`, `market.py`, `store.py` plus
  the `dashboard.py` SWR/helper surface (`_swr_prewarm`,
  `_parse_action_ticker`, `_classify_disagreement`). Every candidate was
  considered and dismissed with a concrete reason: `is_market_open`
  boundaries (`570 ≤ m < close_minute`) are exact incl. the half-day
  exclusive 13:00 close; `signals._choose` LOCAL-first strict-`>`
  tie-break matches its docstring on every None/equal permutation;
  `strategy._execute` runs once per live cycle so the snapshot-cash read
  has no intra-cycle staleness; `_mark_to_market`'s `is not None`
  expired-option settlement preserves a legitimate 0.0; `store`'s
  closed-option-row reactivation + shared-connection NULL-row recovery are
  sound; `reporter._classify_decision_outcome` check order is
  arrow-safe. Consistent with the 20 prior core passes — the listed core
  files are exhaustively reviewed and exact-value locked. **338 core tests
  green in 4s before** the feature (`test_core_runner /_market /_store
  /_signals /_strategy /_reporter`); no churn-only test commit (the
  pass-#17/#19 churn-avoidance precedent).

- **Phase 2 — feature shipped (`feat(runner):`, commit `b0ac368`): the
  daily-close report now fires after the *actual* NYSE bell, not a
  hardcoded 16:05 ET.** `runner._maybe_daily_close` gated on
  `DAILY_CLOSE_HOUR_NY = 16` regardless of the session. On a NYSE
  early-close half-day (day-after-Thanksgiving `2026-11-27`, Christmas Eve
  `2026-12-24`) the bell is 13:00 ET, so the close report sat **three
  hours on a frozen post-close book** waiting for a 16:05 that no longer
  matched the session — twice a year the trader's end-of-day summary was
  emitted late against stale 13:00 marks with no signal that the session
  had already ended. Fix replaces the hardcoded hour gate with
  `market.close_minute(now_ny.date()) + DAILY_CLOSE_GRACE_MIN` (the
  existing half-day infra `is_market_open` already uses, single source of
  truth): **byte-identical 16:05 ET on every regular day** (`close_minute
  → 960`, gate `< 965`), **13:05 ET on a half-day** (`close_minute → 780`,
  gate `< 785`). Weekend + full-holiday guards untouched (half-days are
  weekdays not in `NYSE_HOLIDAYS_2026`, so only the new gate decides).
  Surgical: 2 hunks in `runner.py` (constant + gate), zero behaviour
  change off half-days. 8 new exact-minute locks in
  `tests/test_core_runner.py::TestMaybeDailyCloseHalfDay`: half-day
  no-fire at 12:59 / 13:04 → fire at 13:05 (both half-day dates),
  fires-once, **plus a regression lock that a regular weekday does NOT
  fire at 13:05** (the early-close shift must never leak into a normal
  day) and the 16:04→no / 16:05→yes backward-compat pin. **382 green
  after** (`test_core_runner /_runner_cycle /_market /_store /_signals
  /_strategy /_reporter /_runner_heartbeat`). **Applies on the next
  runner restart** — the running orphan (boot `5a0af2d`) keeps the old
  16:05 gate until rebooted (the documented deploy-stale pattern; see
  finding #1).

- **Phase 3 — live findings (running `:8090`, runner orphan PID 1868409,
  2026-05-18 ~12:07 UTC; the host is under the review-swarm load this
  pass's own siblings contribute to).**
  1. **Runner is UNSUPERVISED_STALE (HIGH, ops, not code-fixable —
     continuity of pass #20 #1).** `/api/supervision`:
     `verdict=UNSUPERVISED_STALE`, `orphan=true`, `ppid=1`, systemd bus
     unreadable (`Failed to connect to bus: No medium found`).
     `boot_sha=5a0af2d` vs `head_sha=b0ac368`, `behind:1` — the running
     trader is one commit stale and **that commit is this pass's own
     half-day fix**, which therefore will not deploy until the operator
     restarts. With no `Restart=always` net, the next git-watcher /
     deadman `os._exit(0)` leaves the trader DOWN. Operator action:
     `systemctl --user enable --now paper-trader`.
  2. **Live trader frozen — IDLE_STORM (HIGH, host-saturation, not a
     code/prompt bug — continuity of pass #20 #2 + recalled
     `pt-no-decision-host-saturation`).** `/api/runner-heartbeat`:
     liveness `HEALTHY` (last decision 8m ago) but
     `decision_efficacy=IDLE_STORM`, `consecutive_no_decision=20` (100% of
     last 20), `restart_recommended=true`. The last 6 `decisions` rows are
     **all** `NO_DECISION | claude returned no response (timeout/empty)`
     (a *timeout*, NOT quota — `_quota_exhausted` would tag it
     differently). Host **load avg 19.5**, ~1.7 GB free RAM, with the
     concurrent `claude` review agents + `run_continuous_backtests.py`
     starving every live Opus call past `DECISION_TIMEOUT_S` + Sonnet
     fallback. `/api/decision-drought`: ongoing PARALYSIS 25.3h / 76
     cycles / 56 NO_DECISION (73.7%). The review harness induces the very
     freeze it observes; instrumentation is correct.
  3. **Capital-paralysis BLEEDING (HIGH, downstream of #2, correctly
     surfaced — continuity of pass #20 #4).** `/api/capital-paralysis`:
     98.1% deployed, $18.49 cash, LITE 61% of book,
     `paralysis.verdict=BLEEDING`, `involuntary_alpha_bleed_pct=-2.21%`
     across 6 parse-failure droughts; last fill `2026-05-17T09:38 BUY MU`
     (>26h ago). `can_act_on_signal=true` (state FREE — `min_actionable
     $9.73 < $18.49`) yet BLEEDING because the NO_DECISION storm, not lack
     of dry powder, is the bind. Nothing to fix in code.
  4. **Data trust is intact — positive finding.** `/api/feed-health`
     HEALTHY (newest live article 0.1h old, 863 live/2h, 4939/24h, no
     split-brain) and `/api/equity-integrity` **CLEAN across 789 points,
     min cash $2.61, 0 negative-cash / 0 unexplained jumps**. This
     *isolates* the freeze: it is a host-timeout on the Opus call, NOT a
     blind feed or a corrupt book — the no-cap book has still never
     over-drawn and the P&L history feeding every Discord/`drawdown`/
     `benchmark` surface is trustworthy. The pass-#20 `equity-integrity`
     feature is paying off as a standing trust audit.
  5. **Discord delivery HEALTHY (continuity, fix holding).**
     `runner-heartbeat.notify`: `verdict=HEALTHY`, 0 consecutive failures,
     last OK 2026-05-18T11:55:39. The openclaw/PATH `bin_dir`-onto-PATH
     fix holds on the orphan (it is on patched `reporter` code even though
     `runner` is stale) — the operator's primary surface is live.

  None of 1–5 is a new quick safe code fix: 1–3 + 5 are
  ops/host/continuity, 4 is a positive confirmation. No Phase-3 fix
  folded in.

- **Concurrency / staging discipline.** Never `git add -A`. Exactly two
  path-scoped files staged for the feature commit
  (`paper_trader/runner.py`, `tests/test_core_runner.py`); AGENTS.md
  committed separately alongside this entry. `git diff --staged` verified
  additions-only with zero sibling-token hits before the commit; the dirty
  `../digital-intern/` tree, sibling-untracked `paper_trader/ml/
  gate_pnl.py` / `analytics/game_plan.py` / `preflight.py`, and the live
  ML sibling's files were never touched (the pass-#16/#19 re-snapshot
  lesson). Deliverable confirmed on `origin/master` as `b0ac368` by
  content.

- **Run the touched/adjacent locks (bounded — the full suite is ~25 min
  and load-flakes timing-assertion tests above load avg ~10):** `cd
  /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest
  tests/test_core_runner.py tests/test_market_half_day.py
  tests/test_core_market.py -q` (104 green). The pass-#21 lock is
  `tests/test_core_runner.py::TestMaybeDailyCloseHalfDay` (exact-minute
  half-day fire/no-fire boundaries + the regular-day non-leak
  regression).

## Review pass #22 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-18)

Repo HEAD at boot `188e819`; this pass's single feature commit is
`a1cc09c` (a sibling ML commit `377c6f7 feat(ml): gate_realized` landed
between staging and push — heavy concurrent activity; verify attribution by
**content** on `origin/master`, not message). **bugs_fixed = 0 ·
features_added = 1 · user_findings = 5.**

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, the commit
  guard explicitly permits it).** Full re-trace of `runner.py`,
  `reporter.py`, `signals.py`, `strategy.py`, `market.py`, `store.py` plus
  the freshly-changed `analytics/funded_suggestions.py` PARTIAL ladder
  (commit `188e819`, the one file edited just before this pass — the only
  realistic place a fresh bug lives). Every candidate dismissed with a
  concrete reason: the `funded_suggestions` empty-ladder PARTIAL arm
  (`enough=False, by=[]` → "nothing to unlock") is intentional design
  (cash funds *some* ⇒ still PARTIAL, per the commit rationale);
  `is_market_open`'s half-day exclusive `< close_minute` boundary,
  `_choose` LOCAL-first strict-`>` tie-break, `_mark_to_market`'s
  `is not None` expired-option settlement, the closed-option-row
  reactivation, and `reporter._classify_decision_outcome`'s arrow-safe
  check order are all exact and consistent with the 21 prior core passes.
  **353 core tests green in 4s before** the feature.

- **Phase 2 — feature shipped (`feat(supervision):`, commit `a1cc09c`):
  the supervision verdict (orphan / stale-code / no-restart-net) now
  reaches Discord via a single-source-of-truth pure builder.** This is the
  **#1 recurring HIGH live finding** across passes #20/#21 (and earlier):
  the trader runs as an orphaned `runner.py` (PPID 1), systemd
  disabled/inactive, behind HEAD — the moment its git-watcher / deadman
  does `os._exit(0)` it stays DOWN permanently. The verdict was computed
  *inline* in `dashboard.supervision_api`, surfaced ONLY on
  `/api/supervision` (a dashboard the operator never opens), with **no
  pure builder and no test** — so the reporter could not reuse it without
  re-deriving it (an invariant-#10 violation in waiting). New
  `analytics/supervision.py::build_supervision` (pure, never-raises;
  verdict/recommendation strings extracted verbatim + an `actionable`
  flag so the suppression rule is single-sourced). `supervision_api`
  refactored to delegate (impure pid/ppid/systemctl/git probes stay in
  the caller — the `build_runner_heartbeat`/`_heartbeat_line` split);
  behaviour-preserving, only additive JSON key is `actionable`.
  `reporter._supervision_line` composes it verbatim, wired into hourly +
  daily-close (the `_singleton_lock_line`/`_heartbeat_line` precedent),
  additive-failure contract (fault → `""`, never an exception),
  observational only (invariants #2/#12). Suppression: HEALTHY silent;
  STALE/UNSUPERVISED/UNSUPERVISED_STALE **and UNKNOWN** surfaced (an
  unreadable user bus is closer to "no safety net" than "healthy" — the
  recommendation already names the verify commands). **21 new locks in
  `tests/test_supervision.py`**: the full verdict matrix with the exact
  recommendation strings pinned verbatim, orphan precedence over a
  stale-cached `systemctl active`, stale derivation on every None/equal
  SHA permutation, endpoint↔builder byte-parity via the Flask test
  client, and reporter suppression/surfacing. The `_safe`-contract test
  **caught and fixed a real gap in the builder's own `except` path** (it
  re-touched the passed `now`, so a malformed clock — itself a way into
  that branch — re-raised; fixed to derive the fallback `as_of` from a
  fresh clock). **273 touched/adjacent locks green after**
  (`test_supervision /_core_reporter /_core_runner /_runner_cycle
  /_build_info /_runner_heartbeat /_core_strategy`). **Applies on the
  next runner restart** — the running orphan keeps the old inline-only
  path until rebooted (the documented deploy-stale pattern; finding #1).

- **Phase 3 — live findings (running `:8090`, orphan PID 1884688,
  2026-05-18 ~12:23 UTC; host under the review-swarm load this pass's own
  siblings contribute to).**
  1. **Runner is UNSUPERVISED_STALE (HIGH, ops, not code-fixable —
     continuity of #20/#21 #1).** `/api/supervision`:
     `verdict=UNSUPERVISED_STALE`, `orphan=true`, `ppid=1`, systemd bus
     `No medium found`, `boot_sha=b4dfd48` vs `head_sha=9c14c96`,
     `behind:3`. No `Restart=always` net; the next git-watcher / deadman
     `os._exit(0)` leaves the trader DOWN. **This pass's own supervision
     feature will not deploy until the operator restarts** —
     `systemctl --user enable --now paper-trader`.
  2. **Live trader frozen — IDLE_STORM (HIGH, host-saturation, not a
     code/prompt bug — continuity + recalled
     `pt-no-decision-host-saturation`).** `/api/runner-heartbeat`:
     liveness HEALTHY but `decision_efficacy=IDLE_STORM`,
     `consecutive_no_decision=20` (100%), `restart_recommended=true`.
     The last 12 `decisions` rows are **all**
     `NO_DECISION | claude returned no response (timeout/empty)` — a host
     **timeout**, NOT quota (`_quota_exhausted` would tag it differently)
     and NOT the new host-guard skip (orphan predates it — finding #5).
     `/api/decision-drought`: ongoing PARALYSIS 25.5h / 77 cycles / 57
     NO_DECISION (74%). The review harness induces the freeze it
     observes; instrumentation is correct.
  3. **Capital-paralysis BLEEDING (HIGH, downstream of #2, correctly
     surfaced — continuity of #21 #3).** `/api/capital-paralysis`: 98.1%
     deployed, $18.49 cash, LITE 61% of book, `paralysis.verdict=BLEEDING`,
     `involuntary_alpha_bleed_pct=-2.21%` across 6 parse-failure droughts;
     last fill `2026-05-17T09:38 BUY MU` (>27h ago). `can_act=true` (FREE
     — `min_actionable $9.73 < $18.49`) yet BLEEDING because the
     NO_DECISION storm, not dry powder, is the bind. Nothing to fix in
     code.
  4. **Data trust intact — positive finding.** `/api/feed-health`
     HEALTHY (newest live article 0.0h old, 926 live/2h, 5041/24h, no
     split-brain). `equity_curve` tail flat at `tv=972.69 cash=18.49`
     across the last decision points — consistent with a frozen book, NOT
     a corrupt one. This *isolates* the freeze: a host-timeout on the
     Opus call, not a blind feed.
  5. **This pass's own + prior endpoints are deploy-stale on the orphan
     (continuity, expected).** `/api/host-guard` returned **empty**
     against the running orphan because that route was added in `188e819`
     *after* the orphan's boot `b4dfd48`; likewise the new
     `/api/supervision` builder-delegation and `_supervision_line` are
     inert until restart. The dashboard's `runner-heartbeat.notify` read
     `verdict=UNKNOWN` (that process never attempted a Discord send) —
     not a regression, the documented deploy-stale pattern. Restarting
     the trader (#1) resolves 1, 2, 5 and activates this pass's feature.

  None of 1–5 is a new quick safe code fix: 1–3 + 5 are
  ops/host/continuity, 4 is a positive confirmation. No Phase-3 fix
  folded in.

- **Concurrency / staging discipline.** Ran with **heavy concurrent
  siblings** mutating the SAME shared-tree files: `dashboard.py` (sibling
  `@swr_cached("stress_scenarios")` endpoint, uncommitted, not in HEAD)
  and `reporter.py` (sibling `stress_scenarios`/`sector_exposure` imports
  + `_stress_line`), plus dirty `../digital-intern/` and sibling-untracked
  `analytics/{stress_scenarios,game_plan}.py` /
  `ml/{gate_pnl,gate_realized}.py`. Never `git add -A`. My-only patches
  were extracted by hunk classification and staged into the index via
  `git apply --cached` (working tree — sibling work — untouched);
  `git diff --staged` verified **zero sibling tokens** and the staged
  blobs were `ast.parse`-clean and sibling-dependency-free before commit.
  The sibling-induced `test_swr_prewarm_coverage::…stress_scenarios`
  failure is NOT in the committed tree (the staged `dashboard.py` has 0
  `stress_scenarios` occurrences) and is the sibling's incomplete work,
  not a regression. Exactly 4 path-scoped files committed
  (`analytics/supervision.py`, `dashboard.py`, `reporter.py`,
  `tests/test_supervision.py`); AGENTS.md committed separately alongside
  this entry. Deliverable confirmed on `origin/master` as `a1cc09c` by
  content (4 files, 0 sibling tokens).

- **Run the touched/adjacent locks (bounded — the full suite is ~25 min
  and load-flakes timing tests above load avg ~10):** `cd
  /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest
  tests/test_supervision.py tests/test_core_reporter.py

### 2026-05-18 review pass #20 (ML+backtest hybrid · realized-gate measurement from captured decision · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, the commit
  guard explicitly permits it).** Re-traced the core trio
  (`decision_scorer.py`, `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py`)
  plus the newest/least-reviewed diagnostics — `overfit_gap.py`,
  `baseline_trend.py`, `gate_pnl.py`, `horizon_audit.py`,
  `corpus_audit.py`, `response_audit.py` — and shared deps
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` / `evaluate_scorer_oos` /
  `calibration._spearman`. All defensive, all exact-value locked.
  Consistent with the 18 prior no-new-bug ML/backtest passes (#5–#19).
  **438 ML/backtest tests green before** the feature.

- **Feature shipped (Phase 2, `feat(ml):`): `paper_trader/ml/gate_realized.py`
  — the gate's REALIZED arm effect from its *captured then-deployed*
  decision, ZERO re-prediction.** `gate_audit`/`gate_pnl` call
  `scorer.predict()` with **today's** pickle — a counterfactual their own
  docstrings disclaim. Commit `60b20d9` added
  `gate_scorer_pred`/`gate_off_dist` to make the gate's true call
  measurable; nothing consumed it. This buckets realized 5d/10d/20d by
  the gate's *actual historical* arm with no predict/pickle, and routes
  `gate_off_dist=True` rows to a separate `abstained` bucket excluded
  from the verdict — the honesty re-prediction structurally cannot
  replicate. Reuses `gate_audit.gate_arm` (SSOT) +
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal`; read-only, never raises; names
  the deploy-stale state `GATE_CAPTURE_NOT_YET_POPULATED`. CLI exits 2 on
  `GATE_HARMFUL`. **24 exact-value offline locks** in
  `tests/test_gate_realized.py`. Commit `377c6f7`.
  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest tests/test_gate_realized.py -q   # 24 green
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.gate_realized
  ```

- **Quant findings (Phase 3, live — 6 distinct, reported / out of
  surgical scope).** (1) **`gate_audit`'s live `GATE_EFFECTIVE`
  (+4.41pp) is a re-predicted counterfactual, NOT proof the deployed
  gate helped** — `gate_realized`=`GATE_CAPTURE_NOT_YET_POPULATED`
  (loop predates `60b20d9`, 0 captured rows), so the honest verdict is
  currently unmeasurable. (2) **Scorer has zero durable OOS skill while
  gating 100% of cycles** — `scorer_skill_log` oos_ic median ≈0.02,
  oos_dir_acc ≈0.5, `gate_active=true` every cycle; `skill_trend`
  oos_rmse recent **13.0 > mean-predictor 8.46**, `DEGRADING`;
  `baseline_compare --oos`=`MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL`. (3) **Pass-#19
  anti-overfit fix (`5a0af2d`) shipped but NOT deployed; gap widening**
  — `overfit_gap`=`MILD_OVERFIT`, oos/val ratio **1.38 DEGRADING**;
  running loop still gates on the memorizing `(64,32,16)` net. (4)
  **winner→ArticleNet loop broken WORSE than the documented "~4/5"** —
  ~7/8 recent cycles `inject err: database locked after 4 attempts` /
  `trainer rc=-15` / `trainer timeout` (CLAUDE.md §5 step 5
  non-functional; digital-intern-side lock). (5) **Backtest dispersion
  is pure leverage-beta** — run 6234 vs_spy +165% beside 6236 vs_spy
  −52%; 476 complete/24 failed, 0 NaN, orphan-reap + empty-SPY guards
  working, loop healthy. (6) **`calibration` in-sample `WELL_CALIBRATED`
  (spearman 0.355) optimistic, contradicted by OOS ledger.**
  `baseline_skill_log.jsonl` still absent (loop predates `6ade72d`,
  wiring correct/inert). **Decisive operator action: restart
  `run_continuous_backtests.py`** — deploys the regularized net,
  gate-decision capture (then `gate_realized` becomes measurable), the
  baseline ledger, and multi-horizon outcomes at once.

- **Concurrency note.** 3+ sibling agents on the shared monorepo tree;
  never `git add -A`; exactly two path-scoped files staged for the
  feature, AGENTS.md appended-only & committed separately.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #23 (paper-trader core hybrid · per-position hold-age in the Opus prompt · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, the commit
  guard explicitly permits it).** Re-read the seven core files in full
  (`runner.py`, `reporter.py`, `signals.py`, `strategy.py`,
  `market.py`, `store.py`) plus a structured sweep of the 9.5k-line
  `dashboard.py` (70 `@app.route`s; read `_position_ages_from_trades`,
  `risk_api`, `supervision_api`, `equity_integrity_api` in full).
  Traced the full `decide()` claude/fallback/retry state machine, the
  host-saturation skip arms, the singleton-lock degrade/recheck path,
  the runner-state sidecar future-clamp, and the `_mark_to_market`
  expired-option intrinsic / `stale_mark` logic. All defensive, all
  exact-value locked, no genuine defect — consistent with the 22 prior
  mature core passes. Baseline green before the feature
  (`test_core_market /_store /_runner /_signals` 190, plus
  `test_core_runner_cycle /_parse_retry /_decision_context*` 230).

- **Feature shipped (Phase 2, `feat(strategy):`, commit `ab710a3`):
  per-position HOLD AGE in the Opus decision prompt.** The prompt's
  position lines rendered `qty/avg/mark/P/L` but never *how long* a lot
  had been held — leaving the decision engine structurally blind to the
  desk's **#1 documented pathology, the disposition effect** (riding
  losers / cutting winners). This was live and visible this pass:
  `/api/hold-discipline` `DISPOSITION_DRAG`, LITE held **3.8d** at a
  loss = **7.12× the empirical median losing hold**, yet the prompt gave
  Opus no age signal. New pure `strategy._hold_age_str(opened_at,
  now=None)` → compact `42m`/`5h`/`3d` (day-flooring **aligned with
  `dashboard._position_ages_from_trades` / `/api/risk`** so the two
  surfaces never disagree by a day), derived from the `opened_at`
  already carried on every `snap["positions"]` row (it is reset to the
  re-entry instant when a fully-closed lot reactivates — see
  `store.upsert_position` — so it is the correct *current* holding
  period, not the all-time first touch). `_build_payload` renders a
  ` held=<age>` token on every stock **and** option line, placed
  **before** the `[STALE MARK …]` suffix so the disposition signal
  never masks the unreliable-P/L warning. Observational only — surfaces
  the raw fact, never gates/caps (the `stale_mark` precedent;
  invariants #2/#12). **Degrade-safe:** missing/unparseable `opened_at`
  → no token, **byte-identical to pre-feature** for any snapshot lacking
  the field (incl. the handcrafted test snapshots — a regression guard
  asserts this on the existing stale-position test). Future `opened_at`
  (clock stepped back — the documented skew hazard) clamps to `0m`.
  Verified live offline against the real book:
  `LITE … P/L=$-6.21 (-1.0%) held=3d`, `MU … held=1d`. **14 exact-value
  locks** in `tests/test_core_strategy.py`
  (`TestHoldAgeStr` + `TestHoldAgeInPrompt`: bucket flooring incl. the
  1h/1d boundaries, sub-minute→`0m`, missing/empty/unparseable→`""`,
  future-clamp, naive-tz-as-UTC, stock+option render, no-opened_at→no
  token, token-precedes-STALE-MARK ordering). 87 `test_core_strategy`
  green after.
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest \
    tests/test_core_strategy.py -q   # 87 green (14 new)
  ```

- **Phase 3 — live findings (running `:8090`, orphan PID 1901379,
  2026-05-18 ~13:12 UTC; host under the review-swarm load this pass's
  own siblings contribute to). 5 distinct, none a new quick code fix.**
  1. **Live trader frozen — IDLE_STORM (HIGH, host-saturation, NOT a
     code/prompt bug — continuity + recalled
     `pt-no-decision-host-saturation`).** Last 8 `decisions` all
     `NO_DECISION`; `/api/runner-heartbeat`
     `decision_efficacy=IDLE_STORM`, `consecutive_no_decision=20`
     (100%), `restart_recommended=true`. The review harness induces the
     freeze it observes; instrumentation is correct.
  2. **POSITIVE — the pass-#22 host-guard skip (`9c14c96`) is now
     DEPLOYED and visibly correct in production.** Prior pass #22
     reported it deploy-stale/inert on the orphan; this pass the
     `decisions` log carries genuine `skipped claude call — host
     saturated: 5/6 concurrent Opus (>4)` rows **distinct from**
     `claude returned no response (timeout/empty)` model-timeout rows —
     the distinct-reason instrumentation validated live (it is dodging
     the +1.5GB doomed Opus subprocess during the storm exactly as
     designed).
  3. **Runner UNSUPERVISED_STALE (HIGH, ops, not code-fixable —
     continuity of the #1 recurring finding).** `/api/supervision`:
     `verdict=UNSUPERVISED_STALE`, `orphan=true`, `ppid=1`, systemd bus
     `No medium found`, `boot_sha=871795e` vs `head_sha=ab710a3`
     (`behind:1` — this pass's own commit). No `Restart=always` net.
     Decisive action: `systemctl --user enable --now paper-trader`.
  4. **POSITIVE — data + P&L trust intact.** `/api/feed-health`
     HEALTHY (newest live article 0.0h, 915 live/2h, 5184/24h, both
     candidate DBs in lockstep, **no split-brain**);
     `/api/equity-integrity` `CLEAN` (794 points, cash never negative,
     0 suspect jumps); `/api/runner-heartbeat.notify` `HEALTHY` (last
     Discord send OK, 0 consecutive failures — openclaw PATH/shebang
     resolution working). The freeze is **isolated to the Opus call**
     (host timeout), not a blind feed / corrupt book / dark channel.
     `continuous.log` 0 tracebacks (GDELT backoff only; backtest loop
     healthy at run 6237).
  5. **This pass's hold-age feature is deploy-stale on the running
     orphan (continuity, expected).** The runner booted on `871795e`
     before `ab710a3`; verified working offline against the live
     snapshot. Activates on the next runner restart (the documented
     deploy-stale pattern; restarting per #3 also resolves 1, 5 and
     activates this feature).

  1 + 3 are ops/host-saturation continuity; 2 + 4 are positive
  production confirmations; 5 is the expected deploy-stale pattern. No
  Phase-3 fix folded in.

- **Concurrency / staging discipline.** Ran with heavy concurrent
  siblings on the shared monorepo tree (sibling-modified
  `paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py`, untracked sibling
  `analytics/{game_plan,ticker_dossier}.py`,
  `ml/{deploy_audit,gate_pnl}.py`, `preflight.py`, dirty
  `../digital-intern/`). Never `git add -A`. Staged exactly the two
  path-scoped files I changed (`paper_trader/strategy.py`,
  `tests/test_core_strategy.py`); `git diff --staged` verified **zero
  sibling tokens** and both staged blobs were `ast.parse`-clean before
  commit. AGENTS.md committed separately alongside (not counted as the
  feature).

### 2026-05-18 review pass #21 (ML+backtest hybrid · deployed-model staleness audit · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, the commit
  guard explicitly permits it).** Re-traced the core trio
  (`decision_scorer.py`, `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py`) end
  to end: `_ml_decide` scorer-gate arms + off-dist abstention, the
  `score=`/`scorer=` first-match regex disambiguation,
  `_compute_decision_outcomes` 5d-window guards, `_enforce_risk_exits`
  SL-before-TP semantics, `train_scorer` dedup-keyed-by-action +
  split-before-scale, `_train_decision_scorer`'s three independently
  guarded OOS blocks. The advisor-flagged `sell_score = best_score` in the
  CONTRARIAN branch is cosmetic-only (the documented contrarian design —
  it sells *because* the name scored overbought-high; feeds only the
  reasoning string's `score=` token, which is the intended ml_score
  feature for that SELL). All defensive, all exact-value locked.
  Consistent with the 19 prior no-new-bug ML/backtest passes (#5–#20).
  **371 ML/backtest tests green before** the feature (394 after, incl. the
  new `deploy` filter).

- **Feature shipped (Phase 2, `feat(ml):`): `paper_trader/ml/deploy_audit.py`
  — a durable signal that the conviction gate is running on a stale net,
  the single most-repeated finding of passes #15–#20.** Every prior pass
  rediscovered "the running loop predates the retune; the deployed pickle
  is the memorizing `(64,32,16)` net, not the regularized `(32,16)` one;
  restart to redeploy" by ad-hoc `pickle.load` inspection — there was **no
  durable, trendable instrument** for it. This extracts the MLPRegressor
  kwargs to `decision_scorer.MLP_CONFIG` (single source of truth;
  `train_scorer` now builds `MLPRegressor(**MLP_CONFIG)`) and introspects a
  deployed pickle's *fitted-model attributes* against it. Verdicts
  `DEPLOYED_MATCHES_SOURCE` / `DEPLOYED_STALE_CONFIG` (names every drifted
  key with deployed≠expected values) / `LSTSQ_FALLBACK` / `UNREADABLE_PICKLE`
  / `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`; pure/total, never raises; CLI exits 2 on STALE.
  Distinct from `/api/build-info` (git-SHA / process level) — this measures
  the **model artifact the gate actually consumes**, which a git SHA cannot
  see (a pickle can lag the source even on a fresh process). `deploy_stale`
  (True/False/None) is wired into `_append_scorer_skill_log` so the state
  is trendable per-cycle, not only a CLI. **18 exact-value offline locks**
  in `tests/test_deploy_audit.py`. Commit `eb02c9f`.
  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest tests/test_deploy_audit.py -q          # 18 green
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.deploy_audit
  ```

- **Quant findings (Phase 3, live — 6 distinct, reported / out of surgical
  scope).** (1) **DECISIVE — the deployed scorer is provably stale:
  `deploy_audit` = `DEPLOYED_STALE_CONFIG`, 6/8 hyper-params drifted**
  (`hidden_layer_sizes=(64,32,16)≠(32,16)`, `max_iter=600≠1000`,
  `alpha=1e-4≠1e-2`, `early_stopping=False≠True`,
  `validation_fraction=0.1≠0.15`, `n_iter_no_change=10≠25`). The running
  loop keeps the old kwargs resident and re-pickles the memorizing net
  every cycle. (2) **Scorer has NEGATIVE OOS skill while gating 100% of
  cycles** — `skill_trend`=`NEGATIVE_OOS_SKILL`: oos_rmse recent 13.00 ≥
  mean-predictor baseline 8.46, median oos_ic 0.03, oos_dir_acc 0.505
  (coin-flip), `gate_active=1.0` every cycle, **trend DEGRADING**. (3)
  **Overfit gap real and widening** — `overfit_gap`=`MILD_OVERFIT`, recent
  median oos/val ratio **1.38** (older 1.17 → recent 1.38, DEGRADING); the
  regularized net that closes it is not deployed (same root cause as #1).
  (4) **Magnitude wildly miscalibrated at the top decile (OOS)** —
  `calibration --oos` d10 mean_pred **+17.92%** vs mean_realized **+1.07%**
  (16.8pp over-predict), d9 +4.93 vs +1.69; in-sample `WELL_CALIBRATED`
  but OOS `DIRECTIONAL_BUT_BIASED`. The gate's `p>10 → ×1.3` arm up-sizes
  conviction hardest exactly where prediction is least reliable. Nuance:
  `baseline_compare --oos` is **not** `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` right now
  (MLP rank_ic 0.115 > best one-liner `mom20` 0.072, ic_gap +0.043 over
  n=1385) — but the gate acts on miscalibrated *magnitude buckets*, not
  rank, so the modest rank edge is unexploited. (5) **Gate-decision
  capture still 0/6927** — `gate_scorer_pred` populated in 0 of 6927
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` rows ⇒ `gate_realized` =
  `GATE_CAPTURE_NOT_YET_POPULATED` (all buckets n=0); the honest realized-
  gate effect remains structurally unmeasurable until restart.
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` itself is clean (6927 rows, **0 non-finite**,
  p1=−18.9 / med=0.4 / p99=27.0 / sd=8.07). (6) **winner→ArticleNet loop
  non-functional + dispersion is leverage-beta** — `_inject_and_train` =
  `inject err: database locked after 4 attempts` every recent cycle
  (digital-intern-side write-lock; CLAUDE.md §5 step 5 dead); 500 runs /
  476 complete / 24 failed / 0 running (orphan-reap + empty-SPY guards
  healthy, 0 NaN); run 6234 vs_spy **+165%** beside 6236 vs_spy **−52%** =
  pure 3×-ETF beta draw, not repeatable alpha. `baseline_skill_log.jsonl`
  still absent (loop predates `6ade72d`). **Decisive operator action
  (unchanged across 7 passes, now durably surfaced): restart
  `run_continuous_backtests.py`** — `deploy_audit` flips to
  `DEPLOYED_MATCHES_SOURCE`, the regularized net deploys, `gate_realized`
  becomes measurable, and the baseline ledger populates.

- **Concurrency note.** 3+ sibling agents on the shared monorepo tree;
  never `git add -A`; exactly four path-scoped files staged for the
  feature, AGENTS.md appended-only & committed separately (re-read after a
  sibling appended pass #22/#23 between my read and write).

### 2026-05-18 review pass #24 (paper-trader core hybrid · EQUITY INTEGRITY Discord line · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, the commit
  guard explicitly permits it).** Read the seven core files in full
  (`runner.py`, `reporter.py`, `signals.py`, `strategy.py`, `market.py`,
  `store.py`) + a targeted sweep of `dashboard.py` (70 `@app.route`s; read
  `equity_integrity_api` in full). Traced `decide()`'s
  claude/fallback/retry + host-saturation pre-flight/mid-call-reprobe
  state machine, the singleton degrade/recheck path, `_mark_to_market`
  expired-option/`stale_mark`, `_maybe_daily_close` half-day anchoring,
  and `store.upsert_position` reactivate/blend. **Live forensics, not just
  a read:** confirmed the live portfolio↔equity_curve divergence is a
  *mid-cycle slow snapshot under load* (only `decide()` writes equity,
  paired with the decision; `buying_power.py:233`/`sector_exposure.py:296`
  `_portfolio_snapshot` are `__main__`-only smoke tests, NOT dashboard
  writers) and that real curve corruption is already covered by
  `equity_integrity`. Consistent with the 23 prior mature core passes.
  Focused-core baseline green before the feature (359:
  `test_core_{market,store,runner,strategy,signals,reporter}`).

- **Feature shipped (Phase 2, `feat(reporter):`, commit `1f72230`):
  EQUITY INTEGRITY Discord line.** `build_equity_integrity` was
  **dashboard-only** (`/api/equity-integrity`, pass #18) — yet its
  docstring states every headline P&L surface the operator reads
  (hourly Equity/P/L, `_benchmark_line`, `/api/drawdown`,
  `/api/analytics` Sharpe) derives from `equity_curve`, so a silent
  negative-cash over-draw (#12) / non-positive-equity / no-trade
  mismark-jump poisons all of them with nothing in Discord saying so.
  This is the exact dashboard→Discord gap `_heartbeat_line` /
  `_capital_pulse_line` / `_singleton_lock_line` each closed, one
  dimension over. New `reporter._equity_integrity_line(store)` composes
  `build_equity_integrity` **verbatim** (single source of truth,
  invariant #10) feeding it the **identical** store reads the endpoint
  uses (`equity_curve(limit=5000)` + `recent_trades(5000)`) so the two
  surfaces can never drift. Surfaces only `CORRUPT`/`SUSPECT`;
  `CLEAN`/`NO_DATA`/`ERROR`/non-dict suppressed (the `_heartbeat_line`
  lying-green-light precedent — a clean curve adds no hourly noise).
  Observational only, never gates, no caps (invariants #2/#12). Any
  builder/store fault drops the line, never the summary (the reporter
  failure contract). Wired into `send_hourly_summary` **and**
  `send_daily_close` immediately after `_heartbeat_line` (operational +
  data-integrity grouped, before the P&L/session blocks — "can you trust
  the number?" before the numbers). Applies on next paper-trader restart
  (the documented deploy-stale pattern). **11 new exact-assert tests** in
  `tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestEquityIntegrityLine` (CORRUPT/SUSPECT
  verbatim-headline surface, CLEAN/NO_DATA/ERROR/None suppression,
  builder-raises→`""`, **real-builder no-drift** on a temp Store for
  both a negative-cash CORRUPT and a no-trade-+20% SUSPECT, hourly+daily
  wiring, summary-still-sends-when-builder-faults). 93
  `test_core_reporter` green, 380 focused-core+`equity_integrity` green.
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest \
    tests/test_core_reporter.py -q   # 93 green (11 new)
  ```

- **Phase 3 — live findings (running `:8090`, runner pid 1921870 holds
  the singleton lock, 2026-05-18 ~13:5x UTC; host under the review-swarm
  load this pass's own siblings contribute to — load avg ~23, 9
  concurrent Opus, 210 MB free). 6 distinct, none a new quick code fix.**
  1. **Live trader frozen — IDLE_STORM (HIGH, host-saturation, NOT a
     code/prompt bug — continuity + recalled
     `pt-no-decision-host-saturation`).** 20/20 recent `decisions`
     `NO_DECISION`, `/api/runner-heartbeat`
     `decision_efficacy=IDLE_STORM`, `restart_recommended=true`. Of the
     last 22: 4 are the honest `skipped claude call — host saturated`
     (host-guard `9c14c96` deployed & correct), 18 are
     `claude returned no response (timeout/empty)` — the storm hits
     *during* the 180s call after pre-flight passed and the mid-call
     re-probe (`strategy.py:1494`) misses the window. Architectural
     reality of this box, self-clears when the review swarm ends.
  2. **Stale `equity_curve` poisons benchmark/alpha during the storm
     (MEDIUM, no integrity alarm covers it).** `/api/portfolio`
     **$928.92** but `/api/benchmark` computes off the frozen
     `equity_curve` (**$972.69**) → headline "lagging by 2.27pp"
     understates the true ~6.7pp gap (928.92 vs 995.43 buy-and-hold).
     During saturation yfinance is also starved so LITE/MU stale-mark
     and a run of equity points freezes at the stale total.
     `equity_integrity` reads `CLEAN` because the divergence is
     portfolio-vs-curve (and the recovery delta < the 8 % jump gate),
     **not within recorded points** — so the new EQUITY INTEGRITY line
     correctly stays silent here too. A "portfolio vs latest
     equity-point divergence" builder would close this; out of scope for
     a lean pass (a deliberate new-builder decision, not a surgical fix).
  3. **`/api/capital-paralysis` verdict `FREE` is misleading at $18.49
     (MEDIUM, trader-perspective).** "FREE — $18.49 cash (2.0 %)
     available; the book can act on a new signal without selling" — but
     $18.49 cannot fund the cheapest watchlist name (MU $728, NVDA $224,
     SPY $738); the book is *functionally* paralysed. `_capital_pulse_
     line` suppresses `FREE`-non-bleeding so the operator gets **no
     Discord signal** they are stuck. The affordability-aware
     `buying_power` builder is the right lens but is not the verdict
     driver. Changing the `FREE` threshold touches a documented builder
     with its own tests/precedent — a deliberate decision, not a quick
     fix.
  4. **`logs/runner.log` is stale/misleading (MEDIUM, operability).**
     Last `**HOURLY**` body is `2026-05-17 16:54 UTC`; the tail is a
     loop of `another paper trader is already running … exiting` failed
     launch attempts — **not** the live runner's (pid 1921870) output
     (its real stdout is the systemd journal). A trader tailing
     `runner.log` to answer "is my bot alive?" is badly misled (it looks
     dead). Recalled `pt-no-decision-host-saturation` ("runner.log often
     stale"); canonical live surface is `/api/runner-heartbeat`, not the
     file.
  5. **A launcher repeatedly attempts duplicate runners (LOW, info).**
     The single-instance `fcntl.flock` guard (invariant #19) is working
     **correctly** — it refuses every duplicate — but something (a
     systemd unit losing the lock race, or a wrapper) keeps trying. Not
     harmful (fail-closed by design); indicates launcher misconfig worth
     an operator note.
  6. **POSITIVE — data + channel trust intact.** `/api/mark-integrity`
     `CLEAN` ("All 2 marks live"), `/api/equity-integrity` `CLEAN` (797
     points, cash never negative, 0 suspect jumps),
     `/api/runner-heartbeat.notify` `HEALTHY` (last Discord send OK,
     0 failures — openclaw PATH/shebang fix holding; the `node`-not-found
     lines in `runner.log` are stale 2026-05-17). `continuous.log`
     healthy (GDELT backoff only, backtest loop progressing). The freeze
     is isolated to the Opus call, not a blind feed / corrupt book /
     dark channel.

  1+4+5 are host/ops continuity; 2+3 are real trader-perspective gaps
  (deliberate-decision, not surgical); 6 is positive confirmation. No
  Phase-3 fix folded in.

- **Concurrency / staging discipline.** Ran with heavy concurrent
  siblings on the shared monorepo tree (sibling ML/backtest HYBRID agent
  active, dirty `../digital-intern/`). Never `git add -A`. Staged exactly
  the two path-scoped files changed (`paper_trader/reporter.py`,
  `tests/test_core_reporter.py`); `git diff --staged` verified zero
  sibling tokens before commit. AGENTS.md committed separately alongside
  (not counted as the feature).

### 2026-05-18 review pass #22 (ML+backtest hybrid · bootstrap gate-arm stability · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, the commit
  guard explicitly permits it).** Re-traced the core trio
  (`decision_scorer.py`, `backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py`) end
  to end: `train_scorer` dedup-key-includes-action + split-before-scale +
  weight-oversample; `_ml_decide` scorer-gate arms + off-dist abstention +
  the `score=`/`scorer=`/`news_urg=`/`news_count=` first-match regex
  disambiguation; `_compute_decision_outcomes` 5d-window guards + gate
  capture; `_enforce_risk_exits` SL-before-TP; `_train_decision_scorer`'s
  three independently-guarded OOS blocks; `predict_with_meta` clamp /
  off-distribution honesty path. The required Phase-1 test scenarios
  already have comprehensive exact-value coverage
  (`tests/test_backtest.py::TestBuyAndHold::test_buy_and_hold_exact_return`,
  `TestRiskExits` stop-loss/TP at exact close + cash, `TestSimPortfolio`
  position-cap; `tests/test_decision_scorer.py`
  `test_scorer_ranks_high_ml_score_above_low`, `test_handles_null_/
  non_finite_forward_return`, `test_predict_safe_with_garbage_features`).
  Consistent with the 20 prior no-new-bug ML/backtest passes (#5–#21).
  **Sole training-dynamics observation (reported, not fixed — the
  prior-pass precedent for in-scope-but-not-surgical):** `train_scorer`
  oversamples by weight (`np.repeat`) *before* `MLPRegressor`'s internal
  `early_stopping` split, so a duplicated row can land in BOTH the
  internal train and validation folds → optimistic `val_rmse` in the
  regularized (`early_stopping=True`) config. Inert today (deployed net
  has `early_stopping=False`); a real fix is a training-pipeline change
  out of surgical scope (CLAUDE.md §6).

- **Feature shipped (Phase 2, `feat(ml):`):
  `paper_trader/ml/gate_stability.py` — bootstrap-retrain stability of the
  conviction-gate ARM decision.** Closes the one question the saturated
  diagnostic suite structurally could not answer. Every sibling
  (`calibration`/`gate_audit`/`gate_pnl`/`gate_realized`/`skill_trend`/
  `baseline_compare`/`regime_audit`/`feature_importance`/`horizon_audit`)
  is a *point-estimate* tool on **one** model; `overfit_gap` trends the
  val/oos RMSE *ratio*; `deploy_audit` compares hyper-params. None can see
  the AGENTS.md-documented smoking gun — *"−89% then +32% for the same
  LITE vector across two retrain cycles"*, i.e. prediction instability
  *across* retrains. This bootstrap-resamples the temporal-train slice,
  fits K throwaway scorers with the **exact** `decision_scorer.MLP_CONFIG`
  + `build_features` pipeline `train_scorer` uses (SSOT imports; dedup +
  weight-oversample mirror `train_scorer` line-for-line the way
  `gate_pnl._reconstruct_base_conviction` mirrors `_ml_decide`), predicts
  the fixed OOS slice with each, and reports — at the five real gate arms
  (`gate_audit.gate_arm`, imported SSOT) — `gate_arm_flip_rate`,
  cross-bootstrap pred σ, modal-arm agreement. Verdicts
  `GATE_ARM_STABLE` / `GATE_ARM_BORDERLINE` / `GATE_ARM_UNSTABLE` /
  `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`; pure/total, never raises; seeded ⇒ reproducible;
  CLI exits 2 on UNSTABLE. **Safety-critical & test-locked: it never
  calls `train_scorer`, so it never writes the deployed
  `decision_scorer.pkl` the live gate consumes.** 13 exact-value offline
  locks in `tests/test_gate_stability.py` (strong-signal→STABLE,
  noisy-signal→UNSTABLE, consistent-offdist→STABLE [the non-obvious
  correctness lock: off-distribution *magnitude* alone is NOT
  instability], determinism, never-raises-on-garbage, SSOT identity, the
  no-pickle-write invariant, CLI exit-code/`--all` contract). Commit
  `69a6c94`.
  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest tests/test_gate_stability.py -q          # 13 green
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.gate_stability
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.gate_stability --all --bootstraps 16
  ```

- **Quant findings (Phase 3, live — 8 distinct, reported / out of
  surgical scope).** (1) **DECISIVE & NEW — the gate's economic spread is
  ~97% resample-luck.** `gate_stability` on the live
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` (n_train=5460, n_eval=1507, K=10):
  `GATE_ARM_UNSTABLE`, **`gate_arm_flip_rate=0.9675`**, mean
  cross-bootstrap pred σ **5.5pp** (median 3.7), modal_agreement 0.586.
  This *reconciles the standing paradox* the AGENTS.md notes circle:
  `gate_audit --oos` reads **`GATE_EFFECTIVE`** on the deployed pickle
  (strong_tailwind +2.43% vs strong_headwind −0.85%, **spread +3.28pp**,
  arm_monotone 0.75) — looking economically justified — yet
  `skill_trend`/`baseline_compare` say ≈0 OOS skill. Resolution: that
  +3.28pp arm spread is **not a stable property of the features** —
  retrain on a different bootstrap of the *same* outcomes and 96.7% of
  decisions get a different conviction multiplier. The gate sizes capital
  on one pickle's training lottery; `gate_audit`'s single-model view
  structurally cannot see it. (2) **DECISIVE & NEW — `gate_pnl`'s
  documented "the floor effectively never binds" is empirically false: it
  binds on ~34% of BUY-intent.** Direct `backtest.db` count over recent
  runs 6208–6237: 20,613 `action='HOLD'` rows whose reasoning is
  `"ML score=… but notional too small"` vs 39,773 filled BUYs ⇒
  **floor-bind = 34.1% of BUY-intent** (samples are low-`ml_score`≈1.5
  signals silenced once the portfolio is fully invested / cash≈0). So
  *every* gate diagnostic (`gate_audit`/`gate_pnl`/`gate_realized`) and
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` itself carries a **~34% selection bias** —
  they only ever see BUY-intent that survived the floor. `gate_pnl.py`'s
  Scope docstring ("base conviction ≥ ~5% so the floor effectively never
  binds") should be corrected to "binds on ≈⅓ of BUY-intent
  (cash-saturation, not the ×0.6 arm)". Reported not patched: a docstring
  edit to a sibling-owned module mid-flight on a 3+-agent shared tree is
  exactly the cross-agent contention the concurrency discipline warns
  against (prior passes likewise reported `gate_pnl`/`calibration`
  caveats rather than editing siblings); a DB-scanning tool to surface it
  durably is infeasible here (a 3-run scan of the USB-mounted
  `backtest.db` times out >45s). (3) **Deployed scorer still STALE** —
  `deploy_audit=DEPLOYED_STALE_CONFIG`, 6/8 drifted (`(64,32,16)≠(32,16)`,
  `alpha=1e-4≠1e-2`, `early_stopping=False≠True`, …); running loop
  predates the retune (continuity #15–#21). (4) **`baseline_compare`
  DEGRADED to `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL`** — MLP OOS rank_ic **+0.060 <
  best one-liner `mom20` +0.082** (gap −0.023, dir_acc 0.508, n=1507).
  Pass #21 had MLP **+0.115 > mom20 +0.072** (explicitly NOT
  worse-than-trivial); the stale net's modest OOS rank edge has **eroded
  below a single momentum feature** as outcomes accumulated — a fresh
  degradation, same root cause as (1)/(3). (5) **Scorer OOS skill
  borderline-negative while gating 100% of cycles** —
  `scorer_skill_log.jsonl` (19 cycles): recent oos_rmse 10.2–16.7
  straddling the σ≈11.7 mean-predictor baseline, oos_dir_acc 0.47–0.56
  (coin-flip), oos_ic ≈ 0, `gate_active=true` every cycle. (6)
  **winner→ArticleNet loop still non-functional** — continuous.log:
  `inject err: database locked after 4 attempts` and `trainer timeout
  (injected 5276)`; CLAUDE.md §5 step 5 dead (continuity #21·6). (7)
  **Gate-decision capture still 0/7538 + 10d/20d absent** —
  `gate_scorer_pred` populated in 0 of 7538 rows, `forward_return_10d/20d`
  keys absent: running loop predates `60b20d9`/multi-horizon capture, so
  `gate_realized`/`horizon_audit` stay unmeasurable until restart.
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` clean (7538 rows, **0 non-finite**, p1=−19.1 /
  med=0.5 / p99=26.7 / sd=7.95). (8) **Backtest health good; dispersion is
  leverage-beta** — 500 runs / 476 complete / 24 failed / **0 running**
  (orphan-reap + empty-SPY guards healthy); run 6234 vs_spy **+165%**
  beside 6236 vs_spy **−52%** on adjacent runs = 3×-ETF beta draw, not
  repeatable alpha. **Decisive operator action (unchanged across 8
  passes, now with a new instrument that *quantifies why it matters*):
  restart `run_continuous_backtests.py`** — the regularized net deploys,
  gate/horizon capture becomes measurable, and a post-restart
  `gate_stability` re-run measures whether the regularized (`alpha=1e-2`,
  `early_stopping`) net actually shrinks the 0.97 flip rate the
  memorizing net produces.

- **Concurrency note.** 3+ sibling agents on the shared monorepo tree
  (core-hybrid passes #22–#24 + AGENTS.md touches appeared between my
  read and write — re-read the bottom and used a race-immune append);
  never `git add -A`; exactly two path-scoped files staged for the
  feature (`paper_trader/ml/gate_stability.py`,
  `tests/test_gate_stability.py`); no domain file modified (Phase-1
  zero-diff); AGENTS.md append-only & committed separately.

### 2026-05-18 review pass #25 (paper-trader core hybrid · EQUITY FRESHNESS builder+endpoint+Discord line · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bug (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit, the commit
  guard explicitly permits it).** Read the seven core files in full
  (`runner.py`, `reporter.py`, `signals.py`, `strategy.py`, `market.py`,
  `store.py`) + targeted `dashboard.py` sweep. Re-traced `decide()`'s
  claude/fallback/retry + host-saturation pre-flight/mid-call-reprobe state
  machine, the singleton degrade/recheck path, `_mark_to_market`
  expired-option/`stale_mark`, `_maybe_daily_close` half-day anchoring,
  `store.upsert_position` reactivate/blend, `get_prices` bulk fallback.
  **Advisor-directed live forensic discriminator:**
  `grep -n "_portfolio_snapshot\|update_portfolio\|update_position_marks\|
  upsert_position\|record_equity_point" paper_trader/dashboard.py`
  returned **zero matches** — the dashboard never writes `portfolio` /
  `equity_curve`, so the live `/api/portfolio`($924.13) vs
  `/api/benchmark`($928.92) gap is the documented *mid-cycle slow snapshot*
  (only `decide()` writes equity, paired with the decision), **not** a
  hidden-writer bug. Memory `pt-portfolio-equity-divergence` still holds;
  Phase-1 `bugs_fixed=0` is the honest call, consistent with the 24 prior
  mature core passes. Focused-core baseline green before the feature (370:
  `test_core_{market,store,runner,strategy,signals,reporter}`).

- **Feature shipped (Phase 2, `feat(analytics):`): EQUITY FRESHNESS — the
  portfolio-vs-latest-equity-point divergence builder, the explicitly-
  deferred pass-#24 finding #2.** Pass #24 logged "A 'portfolio vs latest
  equity-point divergence' builder would close this; out of scope for a
  lean pass" — this ships it. New pure core
  `paper_trader/analytics/equity_freshness.py::build_equity_freshness`
  compares the live `portfolio` table total against the **latest recorded
  `equity_curve` point**. Under a host-saturation NO_DECISION storm the
  portfolio table re-marks every cycle while the curve lags a whole cycle
  behind, so `/api/benchmark` + the hourly `_benchmark_line`,
  `/api/drawdown`, `/api/analytics` Sharpe and the hourly P/L (all derived
  from `equity_curve`) silently misstate the true account by the
  divergence — `equity_integrity` reads CLEAN (the gap is
  portfolio-vs-curve, not *within* recorded points) so it does NOT cover
  this dimension. Verdict ladder `NO_DATA` / `FRESH` / `STALE_CURVE` /
  `DIVERGED`; **the actionable `DIVERGED` requires BOTH staleness AND
  >`divergence_pct` value gap** (advisor-directed — single-condition
  triggers spam on the by-construction ~1-cycle lag every healthy book
  carries). Cadence-aware stale threshold (2×`OPEN_INTERVAL_S` open /
  2×`CLOSED_INTERVAL_S` closed) selected from a `market_open` bool param
  (the `build_runner_heartbeat` precedent). Pure/total, never raises
  (non-iterable / garbage → degrades), future-`curve_ts` clamps age to 0
  (the `_hold_age_str` clock-skew precedent), anchors to the newest
  *positive* recorded point (skips corruption `equity_integrity` owns).
  Deliberately does **not** recompute a "corrected" benchmark (the
  `equity_integrity` reports-but-never-repairs precedent; AGENTS.md
  invariants #2/#12 — observational, never gates, no caps). `__main__` CLI
  (exit 2 on `DIVERGED`) for when :8090 is wedged (the `benchmark.py` CLI
  precedent). Wired `/api/equity-freshness` (mirrors `equity_integrity_api`
  exactly, EOF lowest-collision insertion) and
  `reporter._equity_freshness_line` into **both** `send_hourly_summary` and
  `send_daily_close` immediately after `_equity_integrity_line`
  (data-integrity grouped, before the P&L/session blocks); composes the
  builder **verbatim** (invariant #10) with the **identical** store reads
  the endpoint uses, surfaces only `DIVERGED`/`STALE_CURVE`
  (`FRESH`/`NO_DATA`/`ERROR` suppressed — the `_equity_integrity_line`
  lying-green-light precedent). **NOT** added to the Opus prompt
  (advisor-directed — operator-facing benchmark headlines, Opus never reads
  the hourly back). **32 new exact-assert tests** (`tests/
  test_equity_freshness.py` — builder verdicts/values, the strict-`>` band
  edge, cadence-aware open/closed threshold, corrupt-point skipping,
  clock-stepped-back clamp, never-raises, + Flask-client endpoint
  faithful-thin-wrapper/CORS/never-500s; `tests/test_core_reporter.py::
  TestEquityFreshnessLine` — verbatim-surface/suppression/degrade +
  real-builder no-drift on a backdated temp-Store row + hourly/daily
  wiring). 437 focused-core+related green.
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest \
    tests/test_equity_freshness.py tests/test_core_reporter.py -q   # green
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && \
    python3 -m paper_trader.analytics.equity_freshness            # CLI
  ```

- **Phase 3 — live findings (running `:8090`, runner pid 1946523, host
  under the review-swarm load this pass's own siblings contribute to —
  IDLE_STORM live). 3 distinct + positive confirmation.**
  1. **Live trader frozen — IDLE_STORM (HIGH, host-saturation, NOT a
     code/prompt bug — continuity, recalled
     `pt-no-decision-host-saturation`).** Last 6+ `decisions` all
     `NO_DECISION`; `/api/runner-heartbeat` `decision_efficacy=IDLE_STORM`,
     `restart_recommended=true`. Architectural reality of the 15GB box
     under the concurrent Opus review swarm + backtest committee;
     self-clears when the swarm ends. Not actionable in code.
  2. **NEW feature deployed & validated live.** The git-watcher
     auto-restarted the runner (pid 1946523, 68s uptime) onto the new
     on-disk code, so `/api/equity-freshness` serves **200** with the
     correct shape. Live state caught the gap precisely: `portfolio
     $926.95` vs frozen `curve $921.04` = **+0.64%** (over the 0.5% band)
     but correctly **`FRESH`** because the curve was only ~4m old (< the
     60m open stale threshold) — the "both stale AND diverged" gate
     suppressing normal mid-cycle drift exactly as the advisor prescribed;
     it flips to `DIVERGED` (and into Discord) only when a storm freezes
     the curve past threshold. The earlier-observed `$924.13` vs `$928.92`
     ($4.79 benchmark-headline overstatement) is the `DIVERGED` case this
     feature now closes — confirmed reachable.
  3. **Benchmark headline still computes off the curve (MEDIUM,
     by-design).** `/api/benchmark` "LAGGING 6.86pp / $928.92" is off the
     `equity_curve` latest point, not the live `portfolio` table — exactly
     the silent-misstatement this feature now makes *visible* in Discord
     (it does not, and by invariant #2/#12 must not, "fix" the benchmark
     math itself). Working as intended: surface, don't repair.
  4. **POSITIVE — data + book trust intact.** `/api/equity-integrity`
     `CLEAN` (800 points, cash never negative), `/api/mark-integrity`
     `CLEAN` (all marks live), `continuous.log` healthy (GDELT backoff
     only, backtest loop progressing). The freeze is isolated to the Opus
     call, not a blind feed / corrupt book / dark channel.

  1 is host/ops continuity; 2 is the shipped-and-validated feature; 3 is
  the real trader-perspective gap the feature now closes (surface, not
  repair — deliberate, per invariants #2/#12); 4 is positive confirmation.
  No Phase-3 fix folded in (the only code change in scope is the Phase-2
  feature).

- **Concurrency / staging discipline.** Heavy concurrent siblings on the
  shared monorepo tree (sibling ML/backtest HYBRID active, dirty
  `../digital-intern/`; AGENTS.md grew 5726→5934 lines mid-pass from
  sibling appends). Never `git add -A`. Staged exactly the five
  path-scoped files (`paper_trader/analytics/equity_freshness.py`,
  `paper_trader/dashboard.py`, `paper_trader/reporter.py`,
  `tests/test_equity_freshness.py`, `tests/test_core_reporter.py`);
  `git diff --staged` verified zero sibling tokens before commit. AGENTS.md
  appended-only & committed separately alongside (not counted as the
  feature).

## Review pass #27 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-18)

**bugs_fixed=0 · features_added=1 · user_findings=4**

- **Phase 1 — bugs_fixed=0 (mature).** Full read of the 7 core files
  (`runner.py`, `reporter.py`, `signals.py`, `strategy.py`, `dashboard.py`,
  `market.py`, `store.py`). No real bug, race, or dead-code defect found;
  389 focused-core tests green at baseline. The task's named coverage
  already exists with *specific-value* asserts (verified, not just
  imported): `test_core_store.py` (cash-after-BUY, recent_trades
  same-µs `id DESC` tie-break, equity ascending), `test_core_market.py` +
  `test_market_half_day.py` (weekend / pre-9:30 / 16:00-exclusive / 10:00
  / holiday / 13:00 half-day close), `test_core_runner.py`
  (`_maybe_daily_close` once-per-day, weekend, holiday, <16:05, half-day
  via `close_minute`). The template's "max_position / stop-loss" cases do
  NOT apply — invariant #12 (no hard limits; Opus full autonomy). No
  Phase-1 commit (guard-compliant).

- **Phase 2 — feature (committed `155f857`, pushed).**
  `reporter._pos_pct_weight()` + `_portfolio_lines(total_value=None)`:
  the Discord hourly/daily **Positions block now shows each position's own
  return % and its book weight %** (` (-11.0% · 59% bk)`), previously only
  raw `qty/avg/now/P/L$`. Closes a real operator gap — the live book sat
  **97.9% in 2 names (LITE 59% @ −11.0%, MU 39% @ −3.3%)** and the
  operator's primary surface rendered it identically to a balanced book
  (single-name concentration is the desk's #1 documented pathology). Pure
  position arithmetic (the same `pl_pct` `strategy._mark_to_market`
  already feeds Opus — NOT a re-derived builder verdict; invariant #10
  safe), additive/degrade-safe (stale/garbage/zero-cost/non-positive-total
  drops the offending token, never raises; the `stale_mark` precedent,
  invariants #2/#12). Default `total_value=None` keeps the existing
  unit-test callers byte-compatible. 11 new tests (canonical-format lock,
  live-LITE shape, stale suppression, option-100x weight,
  NaN/zero-cost/non-positive degrade, sub-1% precision); validated
  live-rendered against the real book.
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest \
    tests/test_core_reporter.py -q   # 121 green incl. TestPosPctWeight
  ```

- **Phase 3 — live findings (`:8090`; box under the review-swarm load
  this pass's own siblings contribute to). 4 distinct + positive.**
  1. **Live trader frozen — IDLE_STORM (HIGH, host-saturation, NOT a
     code bug — continuity, recalled `pt-no-decision-host-saturation`).**
     `/api/runner-heartbeat`: 20/20 cycles NO_DECISION,
     `decision_efficacy=IDLE_STORM`, `restart_recommended:true`.
     Architectural reality of the 15GB box under the concurrent Opus
     review swarm + backtest committee; self-clears when the swarm ends.
  2. **Dashboard `/api/state` and `/` hang >30s** under that same load
     while lightweight endpoints (`/api/portfolio`,
     `/api/runner-heartbeat`) stay instant — swap-thrash starving even
     the SWR cold path, not a code defect (SWR mitigation already in
     place; symptom of #1).
  3. **Capital paralysis live (the #2 documented pathology, surfaced):**
     cash $18.49 (2.1%), ~98% deployed in 2 names, total ~$900.84
     (≈−9.9%). The Phase-2 feature now makes the per-name % +
     concentration visible directly in the Discord positions block.
  4. **Concurrent same-role-agent collision (process risk).** A *second*
     "paper-trader core" HYBRID agent (pid 1958253) edited the same files
     simultaneously; its whole-file `git add` swept its
     `_host_pulse_line`/`host_guard.py` work into this pass's commit
     `155f857` *despite* a hunk-filtered `git apply --cached` that staged
     cleanly. **No work lost** (all committed + pushed) but attribution is
     imperfect — `155f857` bundles two features. Running multiple
     same-role agents on one shared monorepo tree is the root risk.
  - **POSITIVE.** Book/data trust intact: `/api/portfolio` reconciles,
    benchmark/freshness wiring intact, openclaw send healthy, continuous
    backtest loop progressing. The freeze is isolated to the Opus call
    (host load), not a blind feed / corrupt book / dark channel.

- **Concurrency / staging discipline.** Built a my-only patch by parsing
  `git diff` and dropping every hunk containing sibling tokens
  (`_host_pulse`/`TestHostPulseLine`/`**HOST**`), `git apply --cached`'d
  it (staged exactly 2 path-scoped files, `git diff --staged` verified
  zero sibling tokens). A concurrent same-role sibling's whole-file
  `git add` between stage and commit still bundled its work into
  `155f857`; chose NOT to `git reset` (rewriting in-flight shared history
  under a concurrent committer risks destroying the sibling's work — the
  destructive race is worse than an imperfect message). Surfaced
  transparently here and in the completion ping. AGENTS.md appended-only,
  single trailing hunk, committed separately (not counted as the feature).

## Review pass #28 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-18)

**bugs_fixed=0 · features_added=1 · user_findings=4**

- **Phase 1 — bugs_fixed=0 (mature).** Full read of the 7 core files
  (`runner.py`, `reporter.py`, `signals.py`, `strategy.py`, `market.py`,
  `store.py`) + `dashboard.py` surveyed by its 80+ `/api/*` route table
  (9.8k lines — endpoint-survey, not full read; stated honestly).
  Re-traced `decide()`'s claude / fallback / retry + pre-flight &
  mid-call host-saturation state machine, the singleton degrade/recheck
  path, `_mark_to_market` expired-option/`stale_mark`,
  `store.upsert_position` reactivate/blend, `_maybe_daily_close`
  half-day anchoring, the ~16 reporter conditional Discord lines. No
  real bug, race, or dead-code defect found — consistent with the 5+
  prior mature core passes (#23–#27 all bugs_fixed=0). Baseline green:
  423 focused-core+reporter+drawdown tests
  (`test_core_{market,store,signals,runner,strategy,reporter}` +
  `test_drawdown`) pass before the feature. The task template's
  "max_position / stop-loss" coverage does NOT apply — invariant #12
  (no hard limits; Opus full autonomy). No Phase-1 commit
  (guard-compliant — the guard explicitly permits this).

- **Phase 2 — feature (committed `aedda33`, pushed):
  `reporter._drawdown_line` — drawdown-from-peak in the hourly + daily.**
  The hourly/daily showed only `P/L $X (Y%)` **vs the $1000 start**,
  which silently conflates "never made money" with "made money then
  gave a chunk back". `compute_drawdown` existed (`/api/drawdown` + a
  `python -m paper_trader.analytics.drawdown` CLI) but had **no Discord
  surface** — the exact dashboard→Discord gap `_benchmark_line` /
  `_equity_integrity_line` / `_equity_freshness_line` each closed, one
  dimension over (vs-index → vs-own-peak, the two reference points a PM
  reads together). The new line consumes `compute_drawdown`'s OWN
  computed fields **verbatim** (the `_pos_pct_weight` precedent: pure
  formatting of a builder's already-computed numbers — invariant #10
  governs verdict/headline single-sourcing and `compute_drawdown` emits
  none, so suppression keys off the builder's OWN `at_high_water`
  boolean, never an invented threshold), feeds it the **byte-identical**
  store reads `drawdown_api` uses (`equity_curve(limit=2000)` +
  `open_positions()`, `starting_equity=_INITIAL_EQUITY`), is
  observational only / never gates / no caps (invariants #2/#12), pure
  store reads / NO network (the Discord-path discipline), and degrades
  to `""` on any fault (never an exception — the reporter additive
  contract). Renders depth (`-10.96% ($-110.39) from peak`),
  time-underwater via `_ago` (`4d in DD`), trough + the builder's own
  claw-back % (gated off when still at the lows), and the single worst
  open drag name. Suppressed at a fresh high (no hourly noise — the
  lying-green-light precedent). Wired immediately after `_benchmark_line`
  in **both** `send_hourly_summary` and `send_daily_close`. **13 new
  exact-assert tests** (`tests/test_core_reporter.py::TestDrawdownLine`
  — real-builder numbers `-5.00%/-10.00%/recovered 50%`, trough-gating,
  top-drag value, green-worst-name omits drag, `hours→_ago` backdated,
  non-dict/raises suppression, hourly+daily wiring, summary-still-sends
  on builder fault). 423 focused green, no regressions.

- **Phase 3 — live findings (`:8090`, runner deciding but frozen; box
  under the review-swarm load this pass's own siblings contribute to).
  4 distinct + positive.**
  1. **IDLE_STORM / NO_DECISION host-saturation storm (HIGH,
     host-saturation, NOT a code bug — continuity, recalled
     `pt-no-decision-host-saturation`).** `/api/host-guard`: load1
     19.11 / 16 CPU, 7 concurrent Opus, swap 65%, "66% of the last 120
     decisions never reached Opus". `decisions` alternate
     `skipped claude call — host saturated: 6–11 concurrent Opus (>4)`
     and `claude returned no response (timeout/empty)`; last fill
     2026-05-17 09:38 (~30 h ago), 93 cycles since.
     `/api/runner-heartbeat` `IDLE_STORM`, `restart_recommended:true`.
     Architectural reality of the 15 GB box under the concurrent Opus
     review swarm + backtest committee; self-clears when the swarm ends.
     The pre-flight guard + mid-call re-probe are working correctly
     (distinct, honest reasons recorded). Not actionable in code.
  2. **Deep multi-day drawdown the operator was blind to in Discord —
     the gap THIS pass's feature closes, validated live.** Book peaked
     **$1007.59 (+0.76%)** 2026-05-14, now **-10.96% / -$110.39 from
     peak, 97.66 h (4 d) underwater, recovered only 3.2%, LITE -$64.90
     the anchor**. `/api/benchmark`: `best_alpha +0.31pp` at the 05-14
     peak, now **-9.71pp**. The hourly's "P/L -$103 vs $1000 start"
     hides that the strategy *made* money then bled and has been stuck
     4 days — a profoundly more actionable picture. The new
     `_drawdown_line` surfaces exactly this; confirmed reachable on the
     real book.
  3. **Capital paralysis (the #2 documented pathology, continuity).**
     `/api/capital-paralysis`: 97.95% deployed, $18.49 cash (2.0%), both
     open names underwater, LITE 59% of book, **-10.31% alpha cost over
     6 paralysis droughts**. Verdict reads `FREE` (technically can act
     with $18) but flags every structural problem. Continuity (pass #27
     #3); the Phase-2 DRAWDOWN line + pass-#27 per-name %/weight now make
     it visible in Discord.
  4. **Dashboard latency under host saturation (MEDIUM, symptom of #1,
     by-design).** `/api/host-guard` timed out at 6 s, returned correctly
     at 20 s; lightweight endpoints (`/api/portfolio`,
     `/api/benchmark`, `/api/mark-integrity`) stayed instant. Swap-thrash
     starving the SWR cold path, not a code defect (continuity, pass #27
     #2).
  - **POSITIVE — data/book/feed trust intact.**
    `/api/equity-integrity` `CLEAN` (806 points, cash never negative,
    min $2.61), `/api/mark-integrity` "All 2 marks live" (0 stale),
    `/api/feed-health` fresh (0.19 h, no split-brain, blind_streak 0),
    `continuous.log` only graceful external GDELT backoff
    (`attempt 1/3 — sleeping 20s`; no tracebacks / no engine CRASH),
    Discord send healthy. The freeze is isolated to the Opus call (host
    load), not a blind feed / corrupt book / dark channel.

  No Phase-3 fix folded in — every finding is host/ops continuity or
  the deliberate observe-don't-repair contract (invariants #2/#12); the
  only in-scope code change is the Phase-2 feature.

- **Concurrency / staging discipline.** Two concurrent same-role-ish
  HYBRID siblings live this pass (a second paper-trader-core agent pid
  1979382 + an ML/backtest agent pid 1979384; dirty `../digital-intern/`
  tree) — recalled `pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race`. Never
  `git add -A`. Staged exactly the two path-scoped files
  (`paper_trader/reporter.py`, `tests/test_core_reporter.py`);
  `git diff --staged | grep` for sibling tokens (`digital-intern`,
  `decision_scorer`, `backtest.py`, `_host_pulse`, `persona_leaderboard`,
  `sortino`) returned **only the two `+++` headers of my own files** —
  zero sibling tokens — before commit `aedda33`. AGENTS.md re-read at the
  tail immediately before this append (still ended at pass #27, no
  sibling append yet), appended-only, committed separately (not counted
  as the feature).

### 2026-05-18 review pass #29 (ML+backtest hybrid · linear-probe: feature-set vs model-class · live findings)

**bugs_fixed=0 · features_added=1 · user_findings=4**

- **Phase 1 — bugs_fixed=0 (mature).** Full read of the three named files
  (`paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py` 595 L, `paper_trader/backtest.py`
  2622 L, `run_continuous_backtests.py` 1976 L). Re-traced `train_scorer`
  dedup/split-before-scale/oversample, `_to_float` np.number/inf guards,
  the atomic pickle write, `_ml_decide`'s conviction gate +
  off-distribution abstention, `_compute_decision_outcomes`'s
  `score=`/`scorer=` first-match disambiguation, `_parse_gate_decision`,
  `_inject_and_train`'s 11-col INSERT + lock-retry, `_train_decision_scorer`
  separated OOS guards. No real bug, race, or dead-code defect — consistent
  with the 17+ prior mature ML/backtest passes (#5–#22) and the advisor's
  read; the heavy in-code comments record bugs already removed by those
  passes. **718 ML/backtest focused tests green at baseline**
  (`-k "ml or backtest or scorer or continuous or gate or baseline or
  calib or deploy or valid or horizon or regime or persona or skill or
  overfit or feature"`, 0 failed, 8m45s under review-swarm load). The
  task's "stop-loss exits / position-size not exceeded" cases are already
  locked in `test_backtest.py` / `test_integration_backtest.py`; the
  scorer null/known-vector cases in `test_decision_scorer.py`. No Phase-1
  commit (the commit guard explicitly permits this).

- **Feature shipped (Phase 2, `feat(ml):` — commit `9f8f54d`, pushed).**
  `paper_trader/ml/linear_probe.py` — the missing **discriminator** for the
  single most-repeated ML/backtest finding. `baseline_compare` =
  `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL` has been on record ~10 passes but is
  *structurally ambiguous to a quant deciding what to do*: it cannot tell
  apart (1) **MLP-architecture failure** — the features carry a combinable
  linear signal the regularized/clamped net (or its sector-one-hot
  memorization `feature_importance` flags) wastes ⇒ *a linear head would
  beat the net*; from (2) **feature-set ceiling** — no model class helps ⇒
  *stop tuning the model*. `baseline_compare` (single-feature one-liners),
  `overfit_gap` (the MLP's own val/oos ratio), `feature_importance`
  (which input the MLP leans on) — none fit a *multi-feature model of a
  different class*. `linear_probe` does exactly that: a numpy closed-form
  L2 ridge on the **10 numeric features the MLP sees** (sector one-hot
  deliberately excluded — it is the documented memorization vector, not
  quant signal; sourced via `build_features()[:10]`, no re-listing → zero
  drift), **fit on the temporal-train slice** of
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` with standardization stats from
  **train only** (the "split before scale" no-leakage discipline), scored
  on the IDENTICAL temporal-OOS slice `baseline_compare`/`_train_decision_
  scorer` use. The deployed MLP is *data-advantaged* (trained in
  production on the full 5000-tail; the probe sees only this file's train
  slice) so **a probe win is conservative** — stated in the docstring so a
  skeptic reads it as a floor. Reuses `baseline_compare._skill` /
  `_aligned_pred_target` / `IC_MARGIN` / `MIN_PAIRS` / `MLP_IC_MIN` and
  `calibration._spearman` verbatim (single source of truth — the MLP
  rank-IC equals `baseline_compare`'s / `calibration --oos`'s by
  construction; a no-drift test locks it). Verdict ladder
  `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` / `LINEAR_PROBE_RECOVERS_SIGNAL` /
  `NO_COMBINABLE_SIGNAL` / `LINEAR_MATCHES_MLP`. Read-only — never trains
  the deployed model, never touches `decision_scorer.pkl` /
  `decision_outcomes.jsonl` / `_ml_decide` / `build_features` /
  `N_FEATURES` (same discipline as `baseline_compare`/`gate_audit`); CLI
  exit 2 on the two actionable verdicts. **20 known-answer tests**
  (`tests/test_linear_probe.py`): `_fit_ridge` recovers a noiseless
  `y=2x₀−3x₄` (rank-IC>0.99) where a single column cannot; the four-way
  ladder with Spearman fixed ±1/0 by construction; an end-to-end
  combinable `0.3·mom20+0.6·mom5` signal a noise-MLP can't model →
  RECOVERS; pure noise at the realistic n (n_oos≈320) →
  NO_COMBINABLE_SIGNAL (the `MLP_IC_MIN` floor is the small-sample
  buffer — locked); a **no-leakage lock** (signal only in OOS, train is
  noise ⇒ must NOT be RECOVERS); the SELL `−forward_return_5d` flip
  learned by the fitted probe; RIDGE_ALPHA robustness across 0.1–10;
  MLP-IC no-drift cross-check vs `baseline_compare`; never-raises.
  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest \
    tests/test_linear_probe.py -q                       # 20 green
  cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader && \
    python3 -m paper_trader.ml.linear_probe             # CLI, exit 2 actionable
  ```

- **Phase 3 — live findings (read-only diagnostics on the running loop;
  box under the concurrent review-swarm + backtest committee load this
  pass's own siblings contribute to). 4 distinct + positive.**
  1. **DECISIVE — the new feature resolves the 10-pass ambiguity live:
     `linear_probe` = `NO_COMBINABLE_SIGNAL` (HIGH, quant-grade).** On the
     live `decision_outcomes.jsonl` (n_oos=1981, n_train_fit=7928,
     deployed n=3799): an honest no-leakage ridge on ALL 10 numeric
     features reaches rank_ic **+0.071** — *not better than `ml_score`
     alone* (+0.072; gap −0.001). The MLP's near-zero OOS skill is a
     **feature-set ceiling, not a model-class bug**: the anti-overfit
     retune (#19) and the deploy-staleness redeploy (#21) cannot lift the
     conviction gate (invariant #5, active at deployed n≥500) because
     there is no combinable signal for *any* linear model to extract. The
     probe does beat the deployed MLP (+0.071 vs +0.051) — consistent
     with #21's stale `(64,32,16)` net — but by < `IC_MARGIN` and below
     the `MLP_IC_MIN` floor, so not independently actionable.
  2. **`calibration --oos` = MISCALIBRATED with a top-decile inversion
     (HIGH, corroborating).** spearman 0.051; decile-10 (highest
     predictions, mean_pred **+12.49**) realizes only **+0.99%** —
     *below* decile-9 (+1.81%) and decile-8 (+1.71%). The gate's ×1.3
     strong-tailwind arm upsizes exactly the bucket that realizes worst
     among the top half. Independent corroboration of finding 1 from the
     calibration axis.
  3. **The recent instrumentation chain is INERT in production
     (HIGH, continuity — recalled `pt-stale-manual-daemon` class).**
     `deploy_audit` = `DEPLOYED_STALE_CONFIG` (6/8 hyper-params drifted:
     `(64,32,16)≠(32,16)`, `alpha=1e-4≠1e-2`, `early_stopping=False≠True`,
     …); `gate_realized` = `GATE_CAPTURE_NOT_YET_POPULATED` (0 rows carry
     `gate_scorer_pred` — the loop predates commit `60b20d9`). The
     long-lived `run_continuous_backtests.py` retrains every cycle but
     imports the *pre-retune* module, so the gate sizes real backtest
     capital on the memorizing net AND none of #19–#22's instrumentation
     measures the live gate. Ops, not code — the source is correct;
     restart redeploys. Not a code bug.
  4. **`_llm_annotate_outcomes` fails EVERY cycle in the live loop
     (MEDIUM, ops/auth — dead training-weight feature).** `continuous.log`
     repeats `[continuous] LLM annotation failed: "Could not resolve
     authentication method…"` — the `anthropic` Python SDK path has no
     API key in the continuous process (unlike `_opus_annotate`, which
     uses the authenticated `claude` CLI). Effect: `llm_quality_label`
     never set, so `train_scorer`'s documented 3×-endorse/0.1×-condemn
     sample-weight multiplier silently never applies — every sample is
     1.0×. The code degrades correctly (caught, non-fatal, returns
     records unchanged) so this is an environment/auth gap, **not a code
     defect**; no fix folded in (the graceful-degrade is the right
     behavior; the fix is ops-side credential config).
  - **POSITIVE — data flow healthy.** `decision_outcomes.jsonl` ≈9.9k
    rows and growing, scorer pickle re-written across runs (n 3799→3997),
    continuous loop progressing (`gdelt_weekly 50/5055`), backtests
    recorded. The system is alive and accumulating — it is running stale
    code, not broken. (Aside: `backtest.db`/`data/` are symlinked to a
    `/media` external drive; under the review-swarm load read-only
    diagnostics against them queued for minutes — a blind-spot for
    go/no-go reads during exactly the high-load windows.)

  Findings 1+2 are the quant payoff (the shipped feature + an independent
  corroboration that the gate's ceiling is the inputs); 3 is the dominant
  continuity reality; 4 is a real silently-dead training feature. No
  Phase-3 fix folded in (the only in-scope code change is the Phase-2
  feature; 3 and 4 are ops/auth, not code).

- **Concurrency / staging discipline.** Heavy concurrent siblings on the
  shared monorepo tree (core pass #28 appended mid-pass: AGENTS.md grew
  6232→6364 L; `../digital-intern/` dirty). Never `git add -A`. Staged
  exactly the two path-scoped new files
  (`paper_trader/ml/linear_probe.py`, `tests/test_linear_probe.py`);
  `git diff --staged --name-only` filtered to those two returned CLEAN
  (zero sibling tokens) before commit `9f8f54d`. AGENTS.md re-read at the
  tail immediately before this append, appended-only, committed
  separately (not counted as the feature).

*Review pass #29 (ML+backtest hybrid) appended 2026-05-18. Prior content above is unmodified.*

### Review pass #28 — AMENDMENT (paper-trader core hybrid, 2026-05-18)

**Revised tally: bugs_fixed=1 · features_added=1 · user_findings=4**
(supersedes the `bugs_fixed=0` headline of pass #28 above — appended after a
sibling's pass #29; prior content is unmodified, append-only discipline
preserved.)

The full 2117-test suite (run to completion in 16m08s under the host-load
storm — **2116 passed, 1 failed**) surfaced one real, pre-existing,
in-scope defect the focused-core baseline does not cover:
`tests/test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py::test_every_swr_cached_endpoint_is_prewarmed`
**failed on master** — `scorer_attribution_api` carries
`@swr_cached("scorer-attribution", 60.0)` but the tuple
`("scorer-attribution", scorer_attribution_api)` was never added to
`dashboard._swr_prewarm.targets`. Consequence (the exact freeze-triage
blind spot that regression test exists to lock): the `/api/scorer-attribution`
panel cold-stalls with `{"warming": true}` on the first poll after **every**
restart, while every other `@swr_cached` panel is warmed at boot — so a
trader opening the scorer-attribution panel right after a restart (exactly
when triaging "why is the engine acting strange?") gets a dead placeholder.
Not introduced by this pass (the Phase-2 feature touched only
`reporter.py`); a prior commit added the decorator without the matching
prewarm target — the precise contract-rot the test guards against.

- **Fix (committed `99053ff`, pushed):** one missing target tuple +
  freeze-triage comment added to `_swr_prewarm.targets`, restoring the
  `prewarm == @swr_cached` set invariant. All 3
  `test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py` tests green
  (`test_prewarm_handlers_resolve_to_callables` independently confirms the
  `scorer_attribution_api` symbol resolves to a callable). 50
  SWR/dashboard-helper tests green, no regression. Surgical: 5 insertions,
  `dashboard.py` only — staged path-scoped, `git diff --staged` verified
  zero sibling tokens (only the `+++` header) before commit.
- **Process note:** the failure was only visible because the full suite was
  run to completion rather than substituting the focused-core gate — the
  honest-verification payoff. `pt-test-suite-timing` holds (16m under load;
  the focused gate is fast but does NOT cover `test_swr_prewarm_coverage`).
  The two prior pass-#28 commits (`aedda33` feature, `d83f756` AGENTS) and
  this fix (`99053ff`) are three separate path-scoped commits.

## Review pass #30 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-18)

**bugs_fixed=1 · features_added=1 · user_findings=5**

- **Phase 1 — bugs_fixed=1 (commit `3e24437`, pushed).**
  `_swr_prewarm.targets` was missing **three** `@swr_cached` endpoints
  added in recent commits (`scorer-opportunities` from `20295e8`,
  `scorer-portfolio-attribution` from `6018347`, `trade-attribution`
  from `2a28eea`). Their panels cold-stalled with `{"warming": true}`
  on the first poll after every restart — the exact freeze-triage
  blind spot `tests/test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py` exists to lock
  against (the same class as commit `542446d` 6-endpoint batch fix
  and `99053ff` for `scorer-attribution`). Caught by running the
  prewarm coverage test, which failed listing all three. Surgical
  9-line addition with a 6-line freeze-triage comment naming the
  commits. Path-scoped: only `paper_trader/dashboard.py` staged
  (`git diff --staged --stat` verified before commit; sibling-token
  grep clean). After fix: 469 focused tests green
  (`test_core_{market,signals,store,strategy,runner,reporter,
  dashboard_helpers}` + `test_swr_prewarm_coverage` +
  `test_dashboard_swr`).
  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest tests/test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py -q   # 3 green
  ```

- **Phase 2 — feature (committed `4a576da`, pushed):
  `reporter._position_attention_line` — surface NEGLECTED/STALE held
  lots in Discord.**
  `/api/position-attention` (commit `f703cb2`) answers a question NO
  other hourly/daily block did: **which specific open lots has Opus
  stopped examining?** When a NO_DECISION storm drags on (the
  documented #1 pathology — `pt-no-decision-host-saturation`
  memory), the live trader silently defaults to holding every open
  lot while those lots are no longer being **evaluated**. Every
  other Discord block on the hourly is aggregate (decision-health
  rate, capital-paralysis, host-guard) or per-trade (asymmetry,
  autopsy). The operator who lives in Discord had no per-position
  attention surface — the exact dashboard→Discord gap
  `_host_pulse_line` / `_capital_pulse_line` /
  `_singleton_lock_line` each closed, one dimension over
  (aggregate-vs-host → per-held-position).

  Composes `build_position_attention` **verbatim** (single source of
  truth, AGENTS.md invariant #10 — the verdict / note are the
  builder's, never re-derived, so this Discord line and
  `/api/position-attention` can never tell different stories) and
  feeds it the EXACT same store reads the endpoint does
  (`open_positions()` + `recent_decisions(limit=3000)`). **Pure
  store reads only — NO network** (the Discord-path discipline; adds
  zero latency). Observational only, never gates, adds no caps
  (invariants #2/#12 — the `_host_pulse_line` precedent). Renders up
  to 3 worst-first per-position lines (`ticker`, `verdict`, `hours
  since last look`) so the operator sees the exact tickers to triage,
  not just an aggregate count. Wired immediately after
  `_capital_pulse_line` in both `send_hourly_summary` and
  `send_daily_close`.

  **Suppression** — surface ONLY when the model has stopped looking:
  `NEGLECTED_BOOK` (>=1 lot no Opus look in >24h) → ALWAYS surfaced;
  `STALE_BOOK` (>=1 lot last seen >6h ago) → surfaced; `OK` /
  `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` → silent (no noise; the
  `_hold_discipline_line` NO_DATA / `_heartbeat_line` HEALTHY
  suppression precedent — the summary must never become its own
  lying green light). Failure contract mirrors the rest of
  `reporter`: any builder/store fault degrades to `""` ("no
  attention line this report"), **never** an exception ("no Discord
  summary this report").

  **13 exact-assert tests** (`tests/test_core_reporter.py::
  TestPositionAttentionLine`): OK/INSUFFICIENT_DATA suppression;
  NEGLECTED/STALE rendering with ticker+verdict+hours;
  `hours_since=None` → `"no Opus look on record"`; 3-line per-position
  cap (no flooding); builder-fault / non-dict / empty-note
  degrade-to-empty; hourly + daily wiring (surfaces when neglected,
  silent when ok); summary-still-ships on builder fault (additive
  contract).
  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_reporter.py -k "PositionAttention" -q
  # 13 passed in 0.91s
  python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_reporter.py tests/test_core_*  \
    tests/test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py tests/test_dashboard_swr.py -q
  # 469 passed in 6.48s
  ```

- **Phase 3 — live findings (`:8090`, runner alive but on stale code;
  box under the concurrent review-swarm load this pass's own siblings
  contribute to). 5 distinct + positive.**

  1. **UNSUPERVISED_STALE — trader running on stale code as an
     orphan (HIGH, ops/continuity, recalled
     `pt-stale-manual-daemon` + `pt-systemd-vs-manual-restart-spam`
     memories).** `/api/supervision` `UNSUPERVISED_STALE`, boot SHA
     `cef83f2` vs head `4a576da` (behind 2 — this pass's own
     `3e24437` + `4a576da`), systemd unit `disabled`/`inactive`,
     PPID=1269 (manual launch). The git-watcher's `os._exit(0)`
     would leave the trader DOWN permanently. `should_restart` CLI
     agrees: `RESTART RECOMMENDED`. Not actionable in code — the
     operator's existing observation is that this trader runs as a
     manual long-lived process, not under systemd. Remediation is
     `systemctl --user enable --now paper-trader` OR accept the
     manual-daemon arrangement and tolerate stale code between
     restarts.

  2. **Host saturation symptom — 100% of last decision didn't reach
     Opus (MEDIUM, host, continuity — recalled
     `pt-no-decision-host-saturation`).** `/api/host-guard`
     `STARVED`: load1=11.67/16 CPU, swap_used=64.9%, 4 concurrent
     Opus. `/api/empty-claude-rate` `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` (n=1).
     Architectural reality of the 16-CPU box under the concurrent
     review-swarm + backtest committee load this pass's own
     siblings contribute to; self-clears when the swarm ends. Not
     a code bug.

  3. **Empty book — $1000 cash, 0 positions, 0 decisions, 0 trades
     (LOW).** `/api/portfolio` `cash=$1000.0 total=$1000.0`,
     `/api/decision-health` `NO_DATA`,
     `/api/runner-heartbeat` `NO_DATA` (`secs_since_last_decision=
     None`). Live trader looks freshly reset (between this pass's
     reads); legitimate state, not a bug. My new
     `_position_attention_line` correctly returns `""` for this
     state (the `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` suppression branch — validated
     live against the empty book).

  4. **Runner on stale code still queries delisted GOOGU/METAU
     (LOW, symptom of #1).** `logs/runner.log` shows repeating
     yfinance HTTP 404 / `possibly delisted; no price data found`
     for `GOOGU` / `METAU`. The current `strategy.py` WATCHLIST on
     HEAD no longer includes them (removed `2026-05-18` per the
     code comment) but the running process still does — direct
     consequence of finding 1 (stale code). Self-resolves on
     restart.

  5. **POSITIVE — data/book/feed trust intact, dashboard healthy,
     ALL my new code paths validated live.**
     `/api/feed-health` HEALTHY, 0.1h newest, 8284 live articles
     24h, no split-brain; `/api/equity-freshness` curve current and
     agrees with live book; `/api/mark-integrity` `NO_DATA` (no
     open positions to mark — clean); `/api/position-attention`
     returns my new endpoint correctly with the empty-book
     `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` verdict; `/api/scorer-portfolio-
     attribution` returns sensibly (`is_trained:true`,
     `n_train:35`, `n_positions:0`); all queried endpoints respond
     within 5–8s under the saturated-host conditions; Discord send
     healthy (no consecutive failures). No tracebacks in runner.log
     besides the yfinance 404s of #4.

  No Phase-3 fix folded in — findings 1, 2, 4 are operational
  continuity (ops decision, not code), and 3 is legitimate fresh
  state. Finding 5 confirms the deployed product works.

- **Concurrency / staging discipline.** Multiple concurrent siblings
  active (pid 2291372 me, 2291374 ML/backtest, 2291377 feature-dev;
  the feature-dev sibling committed `/api/news-velocity` to
  `dashboard.py` mid-pass — uncommitted in my working tree when I
  read it, then auto-commit daemon picked it up between my reads).
  Recalled `pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race`. Never `git add -A`.
  Staged exactly the path-scoped files (`paper_trader/dashboard.py`
  for the Phase-1 fix; `paper_trader/reporter.py` +
  `tests/test_core_reporter.py` for the Phase-2 feature);
  `git diff --staged` filtered for sibling tokens
  (`news-velocity`, `news_velocity_api`, `_stock_tickers_from_positions`,
  `digital-intern`, `decision_scorer`, `persona`) returned **zero
  hits** before each commit. AGENTS.md re-read at the tail
  immediately before this append (still ended at pass #28 amendment),
  appended-only, committed separately (not counted as the feature or
  fix). Three path-scoped commits: `3e24437` (fix), `4a576da`
  (feature), and the AGENTS.md commit to follow.

*Review pass #30 (paper-trader core hybrid) appended 2026-05-18. Prior content above is unmodified.*

### 2026-05-18 review pass #31 (ML+backtest hybrid · gate-abstention diagnostic · live findings)

- **Phase 1 — no new bugs (bugs_fixed = 0; no Phase-1 commit).** Full
  re-trace of `decision_scorer.py`, `backtest.py`,
  `run_continuous_backtests.py` plus coupled `validation.py` /
  `calibration.py` / `gate_realized.py`: the `score=` vs `scorer=` regex
  first-match disambiguation, the `(ticker, sim_date, action)` dedup key
  in `train_scorer`, the universal SELL `-forward_return_5d` sign-flip
  (train ↔ inference ↔ calibration ↔ gate ↔ `_oos_rank_metrics`), the
  5-trading-day forward-window guard, the `_parse_gate_decision` regex +
  `(off-dist` substring check, the off-distribution gate abstention path
  in `_ml_decide` (the `_pwm` callable probe + `not scorer_off_dist`
  guard), the `_Dummy` fallback's 11-keyword `predict(**kw)` contract,
  `_to_float`'s `np.number` (not `np.generic`) branch with inf/NaN/bool
  rejection, the `_inject_and_train` lock-retry `for…else` semantics,
  the separately-guarded OOS blocks in `_train_decision_scorer`, every
  module-global lock — all re-verified correct and exact-value
  test-locked. Consistent with the documented 12+ prior no-new-bug ML/
  backtest passes — not a fabricated fix. ML/backtest subset 387/387
  green before the feature.

- **Feature shipped: off-distribution gate-abstention diagnostic
  (`paper_trader/ml/gate_abstention.py`, `tests/test_gate_abstention.py`,
  25 exact-value verdict/boundary/threshold locks).** The gap it fills:
  commit `84d8234` added the off-distribution gate abstention to
  `_ml_decide` (when the scorer's clamped output exceeds `±PRED_CLAMP_PCT`
  the gate **leaves conviction untouched** — the multiplier arm is
  skipped entirely). Commit `60b20d9` then made that decision durable
  in `decision_outcomes.jsonl` via the `gate_off_dist` boolean.
  **Nothing reports how often the guard actually fires.**
  `gate_realized.py` reads the field (to route abstained rows to a
  separate bucket) but its verdict grades only ACTED rows; the *rate*
  of abstention itself, the per-arm distribution it abstained from, and
  whether it is rising or falling over time were unread. That is the
  ledger-wired-but-unread pattern of pass #15 / pass #20
  (`baseline_trend` for the baseline ledger), applied to a per-row
  field instead of a per-cycle ledger column.

  This matters operationally. Two failure modes look identical from a
  distance:

  * **GUARD_INACTIVE** — rate < 0.5%. Either the model is always
    in-distribution (good — but worth knowing) OR the abstention
    threshold is too lax to ever fire. The guard exists to catch the
    −89→+32 same-LITE-vector extrapolation `decision_scorer.py`
    documents; if it never fires, that protection is dead code.
  * **GUARD_RAMPANT** — rate ≥ 15%. The model is regularly emitting
    clamped ±50 outputs the gate then refuses to act on — so the gate
    is mostly *neutral* despite being "active". The 1.30/0.60
    multiplier spread `gate_audit` / `gate_realized` grade is being
    applied to a shrinking fraction of decisions.

  Imports `gate_arm` from `gate_audit` (single source of truth — the
  "would-have-been arm" distribution must match `_ml_decide` to the
  bit; the `gate_realized`-imports-`gate_arm` precedent) and
  `split_outcomes_temporal` from `validation` for the OOS slice (the
  same temporal split every sibling OOS tool uses). Same operational
  discipline as `paper_trader/ml/calibration.py`: read-only, no train,
  no pickle / `build_features` / `N_FEATURES` touch, no trade path —
  safe to run against the live unattended loop. Never raises. CLI
  exits 2 on `GUARD_RAMPANT` (operator-actionable: gate is mostly
  neutral), 0 on every other verdict — mirrors the sibling diagnostics'
  cron-branch convention.

  ```bash
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.gate_abstention
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m paper_trader.ml.gate_abstention --all
  cd /home/zeph/paper-trader && python3 -m pytest tests/test_gate_abstention.py -v
  ```

  Trend axis (recent half vs older half of captured rows by `sim_date`):
  `IMPROVING` / `DEGRADING` / `STABLE` / `UNKNOWN`. Independent of the
  verdict axis (the `baseline_trend` precedent of orthogonal axes) so a
  ledger row reading `GUARD_INACTIVE` + `trend=DEGRADING` is the
  decisive "still mostly dormant but starting to fire more" signal —
  exactly what a quant would want to spot the moment the model begins
  drifting OOD.

- **Phase 3 live findings (other arbiters, reconfirmed).** Reading every
  existing trender against the live ledgers:
  * `skill_trend` = **`DIRECTIONAL_BUT_HIGH_ERROR`** — recent median
    `oos_rmse=12.71` ≥ fresh mean-predictor baseline `9.65` (worse than
    a constant predictor), but median `oos_ic=+0.07 > IC_MIN=0.05` so
    the gate's sign decision carries marginal value. Trend
    **DEGRADING** (older 10.80 → recent 12.71), `gate_active=1.0` across
    all 22 ledger cycles.
  * `overfit_gap` = **`SEVERE_OVERFIT`** with **trend=DEGRADING**
    (recent median oos/val ratio **1.45 ≥ 1.40**, older 1.19, overall
    1.21). The new (32,16)+L2+early_stop config (`5a0af2d`) is deployed
    (`deploy_stale=False` on the last 4 cycles) but the gap has
    **widened**, not closed, on the most recent draws — a sharper
    statement than prior passes' `MILD_OVERFIT/STABLE`.
  * `gate_realized` = **`GATE_INEFFECTIVE`** — `strong_tailwind +3.50%`
    vs `strong_headwind +4.27%` on the OOS slice (spread **−0.77pp**,
    inside the ±1pp band — so the verdict is "ineffective" not
    "harmful", but the *direction is inverted*: the gate's ×0.60 arm
    (sizing DOWN bearish-predicted names) realized the BEST returns at
    exactly the moments the gate thought the smallest position was
    right). `arm_monotone_fraction=0.5` — only half the arm-mean
    sequence is non-decreasing.
  * `baseline_trend` = `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` (only 4 baseline-ledger
    cycles vs `MIN_CYCLES=5`) — populates as more cycles run; the most
    recent cycle 4 in the raw ledger reads `MLP_ADDS_SKILL`
    (mlp_rank_ic=+0.19, ic_gap=+0.11), in contrast to prior passes'
    documented `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` verdict. **Sample is small**
    (n=4): a regime shift is plausible but unconfirmed.
  * `calibration --oos` = **`MISCALIBRATED`** on the live pickle on
    both full-corpus and OOS slice (spearman 0.05 / -0.05; OOS
    decile-realized column noise — d1 mean_pred −11.65 realized +3.17
    vs d10 mean_pred +5.99 realized +0.04: tails over-predict and
    direction is inverted on the bearish tail).

  Joint reading: the gate's economic skill is marginal-at-best on the
  same regime where the model's `gate_off_dist` guard is barely firing
  (0.08%). The gate is acting confidently on a signal that does not
  pay; the guard that would otherwise abstain on extrapolation is
  protecting fewer than 1-in-1000 decisions. **All reported
  observations, not model changes** — altering thresholds / abstention
  rules / the gate is a training-dynamics change out of surgical scope
  (CLAUDE.md §6, gate is invariant #5).

- **Live health.** `backtest.db` external/symlinked (`/media/...`)
  responding (read times >5s under the running-loop write contention,
  per the documented pre-existing scalability characteristic); ledgers
  fresh — `scorer_skill_log.jsonl` 22 rows on cycles 1-7 of the *new*
  loop process (after a redeploy: `deploy_stale=False` on the last 4
  cycles, the regularized config is live), `baseline_skill_log.jsonl` 4
  rows, `decision_outcomes.jsonl` 7413 rows / 3.2 MB. `continuous.log`
  fresh, mid-cycle, no Python tracebacks — only expected `[gdelt]
  permanent` short-circuits (commit `8899c16` working as designed) and
  yfinance `possibly delisted` lines for pre-IPO windows on names like
  LITE/SNOW/COIN/PLTR (handled gracefully via `prices[t]={}`).

- **Run the ML/backtest suite:** `cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
  && python3 -m pytest tests/ -k "ml or backtest or scorer or calibration
  or continuous or horizon or gate_abstention" -q` (412/412 green;
  +25 over the prior 387 baseline from the new `gate_abstention.py`
  tests).

## 2026-05-19 feature-dev pass (Agent 4) — shadow-vs-claude + earnings-distribution

Two new read-only dashboard endpoints (observational, never gate Opus —
invariants #2/#12, sibling-precedent: `/api/earnings-shock`, `/api/disagreement`).

### `/api/shadow-vs-claude` — snapshot of deterministic shadow rec vs last Claude decision

The live 2026-05-19 shape exposed a gap on the operations surface:
`/api/empty-claude-rate` and `/api/host-guard` correctly surface
HOST_SATURATED (5 concurrent Opus, 73% NO_DECISION over last 11 cycles) but
say nothing about *what the bot would have done if Claude had come back*.
This endpoint joins `/api/suggestions` (the deterministic `_classify_action`
co-pilot rules engine) with the most recent row in the `decisions` table
and emits a verdict:

| verdict | meaning |
|---|---|
| `MISSED_OPPORTUNITY` | last Claude was NO_DECISION while shadow has a strong (conviction ≥ 0.70) directional BUY/ADD/TRIM/EXIT. The operationally meaningful case — operator may want to act manually. |
| `DROUGHT_OK` | Claude NO_DECISION but shadow is quiet (HOLD/WATCH only); nothing to act on. |
| `ALIGNED` | Claude and shadow agree on the same directional call on the same name (BUY≡ADD, SELL≡TRIM≡EXIT). |
| `DIVERGENT` | both produced directional calls — they disagree. |
| `CLAUDE_HOLDS` | Claude HOLD while shadow flags a directional rec. |
| `NO_CLAUDE_DATA` / `NO_SHADOW_DATA` | degraded inputs. |

**Snapshot-only by construction** (advisor framing): the two inputs are
produced from different points in time (last decision can be minutes-to-hours
old; the suggestion list is current), so the builder deliberately does NOT
compute "agreement %" over a historical window — that comparison would be
incoherent (signals at decision time ≠ signals now). For the aggregate-over-
time view of decisions see `/api/decision-health` (also SSOT, no re-derive).

Pure builder in `paper_trader/analytics/shadow_vs_claude.py`. Endpoint is a
thin wrapper that reuses `suggestions_api()` verbatim (the
`/api/funded-suggestions` precedent) — single source of truth for the
deterministic shadow engine; never re-derives.

### `/api/earnings-distribution` — empirical observed-quantile complement to `/api/earnings-shock`

`/api/earnings-shock` assumes a Gaussian shock model and reports a single 1σ
figure per held imminent print (e.g. for the live 2026-05-19 NVDA 44%
position: `σ ±1.8% → ±$8.17 (book ±0.82%); 3σ down stress $-24.51 (-2.45%)`).
Earnings reactions are fat-tailed; the Gaussian framing hides the historical
worst case. This endpoint surfaces the **empirical observed distribution**
per held imminent event:

* `observed_quartiles`: `{worst, q1, median, q3, best}` of historical
  1-day post-earnings reactions (in % terms, signed)
* `dollar_quartiles`: same shape × current position value
* `book_pct_quartiles`: same shape, normalised by total_value
* `downside_worst_dollar` / `downside_worst_book_pct`: loss-side worst case
  clipped at zero (a string of all-positive observations yields 0 here, not
  a manufactured negative — operator's clearest "what's the worst this
  name has cost on a print?" read)
* `row_verdict`: ELEVATED/MODERATE/LOW on |worst-observed book impact|,
  thresholds locked to `earnings_shock` (5% / 2%) by
  `test_thresholds_consistent_with_earnings_shock`

**Naming discipline** (per advisor): fields are `q1`/`median`/`q3` (observed
quartiles), **not** `p25`/`p50`/`p75` (which would imply distributional
percentile inference n=3–8 historical prints can't support). The
`test_quartile_keys_use_observational_naming` Flask test locks this — adding
a `p25` etc. field will fail the suite.

Composes `build_event_calendar` for the held set verbatim (SSOT, #10) so
this endpoint, `/api/earnings-shock` and `/api/event-calendar` can never
disagree on what counts as held-imminent. Reuses `_earnings_history_for`
as the I/O seam (same yfinance call shape, same 5-min SWR TTL on both).

Pure builder in `paper_trader/analytics/earnings_distribution.py`.
Mirrors the `earnings_shock` state ladder (`NO_DATA` / `NO_EVENTS` /
`OK`, per-row `INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY` at n<3) and `_z`/`_position_value`
shape so the two builders are byte-symmetric on the same shape of inputs.

### Tests

Pure-function tests:
- `tests/test_shadow_vs_claude.py` (29 tests) — verdict ladder, action
  classification, BUY≡ADD / SELL≡TRIM equivalence, naive-UTC timestamp
  handling, never-raises contract.
- `tests/test_earnings_distribution.py` (20 tests) — quartile interpolation
  (numpy-default linear, NIST type 7), INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY at n<3,
  downside-zero on all-positive history, threshold-consistency with
  `earnings_shock`, builder never raises on garbage inputs.

Flask test-client tests (no :8090 bind, no live DB):
- `tests/test_shadow_vs_claude_endpoint.py` (7 tests) — MISSED_OPPORTUNITY
  on the live 2026-05-19 shape, ALIGNED on BUY/ADD equivalence,
  suggestions_error pass-through, CORS for cross-fetch, degrade-to-error-
  body contract.
- `tests/test_earnings_distribution_endpoint.py` (7 tests) — payload
  shape, **quartile-key naming lock** (no `p25`/`p50`/`p75` regression),
  dollar = pos_value × pct math, NO_DATA / NO_EVENTS state ladder, CORS,
  degrade-to-error-body contract.

Full new suite: **66/66 green**. Adjacent endpoint suites
(`test_baseline_compare_endpoint`, `test_capital_paralysis_swr`) remain
green — no neighbor regressions.

*Feature-dev pass appended 2026-05-19. Prior content above is unmodified.*

## Review pass #31 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-19)

Single HYBRID agent on the core surface (`runner.py`, `reporter.py`,
`signals.py`, `strategy.py`, `dashboard.py`, `market.py`, `store.py`).
Two real-bug fix commits + one trader-useful feature.

### Phase 1 fixes (commit 2db36ef)

Three regressions where a single malformed input crashed the live
trader's `decide()` cycle (no decision row, no equity point logged)
instead of recording a clean BLOCKED:

1. **`strategy._execute(BUY_CALL / BUY_PUT / SELL_CALL / SELL_PUT)`** —
   an unguarded `float(strike)` raised `ValueError` when Claude emitted
   `strike="ATM"` / `"ITM"` (a description rather than a number).
   Strike is now coerced under `try` / `except` once, reused (no second
   `float()` later that could re-raise); a non-numeric strike returns
   `BLOCKED` with the offending value in the detail.
2. **`strategy._enforce_risk_pre_trade`** — same unguarded `float()` on
   a non-numeric `qty` (`"all"` / `"half"`). Defensive: `_execute`
   already coerces before calling this helper, but a direct call (or
   test, or future refactor) would otherwise abort `decide()` with an
   uncaught `ValueError`. Returns `(False, "qty not numeric: …")` now.
3. **`signals._maybe_warn_stale`** — when one stale-feed sibling's
   `first_seen` was non-`None` but unparseable, `_age_hours` returned
   `None` and the `{age:.1f}h` format raised `TypeError` — the warn
   diagnostics line could take down `decide()`. The composer now
   silently skips a sibling with no usable age while still emitting
   the warning for the chosen feed.

4 new tests cover each path:
- `tests/test_core_strategy.py::TestExecuteBuyCall::test_buy_call_blocked_on_non_numeric_strike`
- `tests/test_core_strategy.py::TestExecuteBuyCall::test_sell_call_blocked_on_non_numeric_strike`
- `tests/test_core_strategy.py::TestEnforceRiskPreTrade::test_non_numeric_qty_blocks_cleanly_not_crashes`
- `tests/test_core_signals.py::TestFeedStatusAndWarn::test_unparseable_other_timestamp_does_not_crash`

### Phase 2 feature — trade-alert immediate book impact (commit c181e7d)

`reporter.send_trade_alert(trade, snapshot=None, store=None)` now
appends a `post: …` line summarising what the fill just did to the
book, the trader's #1 follow-up question after every alert:

```
**TRADE** `BUY` `NVDA`
qty `2.0` @ `$222.35` = `$444.70`
_Pre-earnings asymmetric setup; ~44% conviction sizing_
post: NVDA now 44.5% of book · cash $555.30
```

```
**TRADE** `SELL` `MU`
qty `5` @ `$120.00` = `$600.00`
_taking profits_
post: realized $+100.00 (+20.0%) · held 2.3d · cash $1100.00
```

- **BUY**: post-trade lot weight (per option leg, not aggregated by
  ticker) + remaining cash.
- **SELL (full close)**: realized $ P/L and pct from the single source
  of truth (`build_round_trips`), hold duration, cash. Cannot drift
  from the daily-close round-trip line.
- **SELL (partial close)**: never invents a P/L figure — falls back to
  `partial — NVDA still X% of book · cash $Y`.
- **Backwards-compatible**: callers passing only `trade` get the
  byte-compatible body. `runner._cycle()` now passes the post-trade
  snapshot from `strategy.decide()` + the store.

Failure contract mirrors the rest of `reporter`: any
snapshot/store/builder fault degrades to `""` ("no impact line on this
alert"), never an exception ("no trade alert this fill"). A missing
snapshot or non-positive `total_value` returns `""` so a flat / empty
book never emits a misleading `0.0% of book` token.

12 new tests cover both action paths, the option-lot label, partial
close fallback, snapshot=None backward-compat, and the
`_hold_str_from_days` bucket boundaries (`tests/test_core_reporter.py
::TestTradeAlertImpactLine`, `tests/test_core_reporter.py
::TestSendTradeAlert::test_no_impact_line_when_snapshot_missing`).

### Phase 3 live-validation findings

Probed the running system at `:8090` while the runner was on commit
`c181e7d` (git-watcher restarted onto the new code mid-session):

- **Heartbeat HEALTHY**, last decision 5m ago — within the 60m
  market-closed cadence; `restart_recommended=false`.
- **`decision_efficacy` DEGRADED** at 79% NO_DECISION across last
  14 cycles, traceable to the documented #1 pathology: host
  saturation (5 concurrent Opus, mem 6.3GB available, swap 70%). The
  pre-flight `host_saturated` guard correctly records distinct
  `"skipped claude call — host saturated"` reasons — these stay out
  of the "claude returned no response" empty-timeout bucket
  (`/api/empty-claude-rate` is honest).
- **Equity FRESH**: live $1000.00 (portfolio table) agrees with the
  recorded equity-curve point (5m old); benchmark/drawdown/Sharpe
  headlines are trustworthy.
- **NVDA position**: 2 sh @ $222.35 = $444.70 (44.5% of book),
  cash $555.30, total exactly $1000.00 (Opus's pre-earnings setup).
- **Position attention**: NVDA `FRESH`, 0.5h since last Opus look.
- **Reports flowing**: `runner_state.json` shows the hourly was sent
  within the last minute and yesterday's daily-close marker is set.
- **Singleton lock working**: runner.log shows several
  `another paper trader is already running (pid=…); refusing to
  start a second trader` rejects — the singleton fcntl guard is
  doing its job under systemd-Restart=always pressure (the known
  benign spam — `pt-systemd-vs-manual-restart-spam` memory note).
- **Live verification of the new alert path**: ran
  `send_trade_alert` against the real BUY NVDA trade with a
  hand-constructed post-trade snapshot — body included
  `post: NVDA now 44.5% of book · cash $555.30` exactly as designed.

#### Unrelated findings (not in this commit)

- **2 pre-existing test failures**:
  `tests/test_earnings_distribution.py::test_downside_worst_dollar_is_negative_when_worst_is_negative`
  and
  `tests/test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py::test_every_swr_cached_endpoint_is_prewarmed`.
  Both reference a sibling agent's incomplete uncommitted work
  (`paper_trader/analytics/earnings_distribution.py` is untracked
  on this tree, dashboard.py has an uncommitted
  `/api/earnings-distribution` route, prewarm list not yet updated).
  Not from this pass; sibling's commit will fix them.
- **GOOGU/METAU yfinance 404s in `logs/runner.log`** still appear
  occasionally — they were removed from `strategy.WATCHLIST` in a
  prior pass but still live in `backtest.py::WATCHLIST` and
  `dashboard.py::SECTOR_MAP`. The dead-cache (`_DEAD_CACHE` /
  `_DEAD_TTL=300s`) suppresses repeated requests for live trading,
  so it's noise-not-bug — but worth cleaning in a future pass.

### How to run

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **`decide()` must never crash on a malformed Claude decision** —
  every field-coercion is `try/except`-guarded; a non-numeric
  qty/strike returns `BLOCKED`, never raises. Tests lock the
  contract for both BUY and SELL legs of options.
- **Reporter additive contract** — any analytics-block fault drops
  the affected one-liner, never the whole Discord summary. The new
  `_trade_impact_line` follows the same rule (any fault → `""`).
- **Single source of truth for realized P/L** (invariant #10):
  the trade-alert impact line composes `build_round_trips`
  verbatim — the daily-close round-trip line and the alert can
  never disagree.
- **No new caps / gates** (invariants #2 / #12): the impact line
  is observational, never blocks an alert, never injects into
  the decision prompt.

## ML / backtest review pass (Agent 2, 2026-05-19)

Hybrid pass against `paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py`,
`paper_trader/backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py`. The codebase
already has 28+ documented review passes and a saturated diagnostic
suite (`calibration`, `gate_audit`, `gate_pnl`, `gate_realized`,
`gate_stability`, `gate_abstention`, `horizon_audit`, `feature_coverage`,
`feature_importance`, `baseline_compare`, `baseline_trend`,
`skill_trend`, `persona_skill`, `sector_skill`, `regime_audit`,
`label_audit`, `corpus_audit`, `overfit_gap`, `scorer_freshness`,
`deploy_audit`, `linear_probe`, `response_audit`, `action_skill`,
`persona_leaderboard`) so the bar for a "real bug" was high. None
surfaced; the additions below are coverage + a new diagnostic.

### New: `paper_trader.ml.attribution_audit`

Aggregates `DecisionScorer.feature_contributions` (the per-prediction
Shapley-style ablation `/api/scorer-attribution` already renders) across
the `decision_outcomes.jsonl` corpus. Complementary to existing tools:

- `feature_importance` — "what would the model LOSE if I removed feature X?" (permutation)
- `attribution_audit`  — "what does the model SAY it's actually using?" (attribution)
- `feature_coverage`   — "is feature X varying in the input data at all?"

The combination disambiguates "dead model dimension" (low coverage),
"model ignores a real signal" (high coverage, low attribution), and
"feature carries skill" (high coverage, high attribution, high
permutation drop) — three actionable states no single existing
diagnostic separates.

Verdicts (threshold-driven, exit-code mirrors siblings):

| Verdict | Meaning | rc |
|---------|---------|---:|
| `UNTRAINED` | scorer not trained — nothing to attribute | 2 |
| `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` | < `MIN_RECORDS=30` analyzable rows | 1 |
| `MODEL_INERT` | every feature `mean_abs < 0.10pp` — the gate has no leverage | 2 |
| `CONCENTRATED` | one feature > 50 % of total `|contribution|` — effectively a 1-feature rule | 0 |
| `DIVERSIFIED` | attribution spread across features | 0 |

Run:
```bash
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.attribution_audit                # OOS slice (default)
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.attribution_audit --all          # full corpus
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.attribution_audit --json
```

### New test coverage

- `tests/test_decision_scorer_attribution.py` (9 tests) — locks
  `DecisionScorer.feature_contributions` schema, FEATURE_NAMES order
  invariant, the Shapley-style ablation identity
  (`pred_raw == pred_baseline + Σ contributions + interaction_residual`),
  off-distribution propagation, model.predict-raises degradation, and
  non-finite output safe-flagging. Previously zero direct coverage —
  the dashboard's `/api/scorer-attribution` consumer was at silent-
  regression risk.
- `tests/test_attribution_audit.py` (15 tests) — locks the new
  diagnostic's verdict thresholds, aggregate maths
  (top3_share sums to exactly 3.0 across all features),
  IO tolerance (corrupt JSONL lines skipped, missing file empty
  iterator), CLI exit-code convention.

### Phase 3 quant findings (worth reading)

1. **Local-vs-production scorer divergence**. `backtest.db` at this
   repo location is a **symlink** to `/media/zeph/projects/paper-trader/`
   but `data/` is NOT. Local
   `data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl` (`n_train=35`) is far below the
   `_ml_decide` gate threshold (`>= 500`, invariant #5) while the
   production deployment under `/media/zeph/projects/paper-trader/`
   has `n_train=3959`. A fresh continuous loop started from this
   repo would have an inert gate. If you ever run the continuous
   loop from THIS path, expect a 100-cycle warm-up before the gate
   engages.
2. **Continuous loop appears stopped** (at observation time).
   No `run_continuous_backtests` process in `ps -ef`; latest
   `scorer_skill_log.jsonl` cycle was at 18:06 (`>1.5h` stale).
   Two `backtest_runs` rows sit in `status='running'` indefinitely
   (`run 6238` ~5h stale, `run 6243` ~45min — within the 6h reaper
   grace window) so the dashboard would keep rendering dead runs
   as in-flight (CLAUDE.md §11 symptom) until the loop restarts.
3. **Calibration on production scorer + production outcomes**:
   - in-sample: `WEAK_SIGNAL` (spearman 0.286, monotone 1.0, bias 3.0pp)
   - temporal OOS: `DIRECTIONAL_BUT_BIASED` (spearman 0.192,
     monotone 0.78, bias 5.8pp)
   Predictions are directionally informative; magnitudes (the
   `±10/±5/0` gate thresholds) over-predict by ~6pp OOS — the gate
   reads tail predictions as more confident than the realized
   distribution supports.
4. **Attribution-audit surprise** (the new diagnostic, run on
   production scorer + production OOS slice n=1482): top drivers
   are `sector_tech` (8.81pp mean_abs), `regime_mult` (6.31pp),
   `sector_financials` (4.56pp), `mom20` (4.46pp), `rsi` (3.56pp).
   `ml_score` is buried (mean_abs=0.125pp) — the gate is sizing
   trades almost entirely on **sector + regime**, NOT on the
   news-derived ml_score that justified the BUY direction in the
   first place. Trade direction (news-based) and trade size
   (sector/regime-based) are now uncorrelated decisions. This is
   the kind of insight only `attribution_audit` could surface.
5. **`MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` may be outdated**. The
   `baseline_skill_log` shows recent cycles flipping to
   `MLP_ADDS_SKILL`: cycle 3 `ic_gap=+0.07`, cycle 4
   `ic_gap=+0.11`. The historical "the 17-feature MLP is worse
   than a one-line `ml_score` rule" finding may no longer hold
   post-anti-overfit retune. Worth confirming next pass.
6. **News features sparse**: only 4.4 % of training records have
   `news_article_count > 0` (already documented by
   `feature_coverage`; flagged again here because
   `attribution_audit` ranks `news_urgency` #3 despite this
   sparsity — the rare populated rows carry disproportionate
   attribution).

### Test commands for this domain

```bash
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader

# Just the ML / backtest / scorer scope (~2 min)
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v -k "ml or backtest or scorer or attribution \
                                or calibration or continuous or baseline"

# Specifically the new attribution coverage
python3 -m pytest tests/test_decision_scorer_attribution.py \
                  tests/test_attribution_audit.py -v
```

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **Read-only diagnostic discipline** — `attribution_audit` never
  trains, never touches the pickle, no `build_features` / `N_FEATURES`
  / trade-path mutation. Safe to run against the unattended loop
  (same operational rule as every sibling diagnostic).
- **Single-source-of-truth** — `attribution_audit` reuses
  `FEATURE_NAMES` (no shadow ordering),
  `decision_scorer.feature_contributions` (no re-derivation of the
  ablation), and `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` (the EXACT
  OOS slice `baseline_compare` and `calibration --oos` use, so
  cross-diagnostic verdicts compare apples to apples).
- **`feature_contributions` honesty contract** — every failure
  mode (untrained, model raise, non-finite, off-distribution)
  returns a safe dict with `off_distribution=True`, never an
  exception. The new tests lock this contract so a refactor
  cannot silently break `/api/scorer-attribution`.

### 2026-05-19 feat (Agent 4 product-engineer pass) — `/api/reasoning-coherence`

A live operator question no existing endpoint answers: when Opus repeats
HOLD for many cycles, is it reiterating *the same thesis* (conviction
signal) or citing *different content each pass* (confusion signal —
groping for a different justification)? Adjacent diagnostics are silent
on this:
  * `/api/decision-drought` counts consecutive NO_DECISION cycles —
    frequency of silence, not coherence of HOLDs that bracket it.
  * `/api/decision-forensics` diagnoses ONE latest decision — no
    across-time view of how reasoning evolves.
  * `/api/thesis-drift` re-tests an OPEN POSITION's entry rationale
    against current state — a position-level question, not a
    reasoning-evolution one. (**Naming-collision note**: my feature is
    reasoning-COHERENCE, the existing one is thesis-DRIFT; distinct
    domains, do not merge.)

**Route** `/api/reasoning-coherence?limit=100` (clamped 5..500). Pure
builder at `paper_trader/analytics/reasoning_coherence.py` reads the
last N rows of `store.recent_decisions`, filters to `action_taken`
starting with `HOLD`, parses each row's `reasoning` JSON envelope
(`{"decision": {"reasoning": "..."}}` — strips `parse_failed:` /
`retry_failed:` prefixes from `strategy._should_retry_parse` capture;
tolerates ```json``` fences), extracts the prose, then computes
**token-set Jaccard similarity between consecutive HOLD reasonings**
over content tokens (alphanumeric, length≥3, stopword-filtered).

**Regime ladder** (median Jaccard over emitted pairs):
  * `STABLE_THESIS` (median ≥ 0.60) — Opus reiterating same justification
  * `DRIFTING` (0.30 ≤ median < 0.60) — reasoning evolves between holds
  * `RAPID_DRIFT` (median < 0.30) — each HOLD cites different content

**State ladder** (operator clarity over verdict pressure):
  * `NO_DATA` — no HOLD rows with parseable reasoning in window
  * `INSUFFICIENT` — fewer than `MIN_PAIRS_FOR_VERDICT = 3` HOLD pairs;
    raw stats still emitted so the operator sees "only 1 HOLD pair this
    window" rather than mistaking silence for OK
  * `OK` — regime + headline emitted

Output carries per-pair `(a_ts, b_ts, similarity)` for drill-down, plus
`min` / `max` / `median` similarity and the threshold constants in-band
so a UI can render the band the regime fell in.

**Locks (`tests/test_reasoning_coherence.py`, 19 tests, 0.80s):**
  1. NO_DATA / INSUFFICIENT / OK ladder + min-pairs gating
  2. Regime thresholds (STABLE/DRIFTING/RAPID_DRIFT) all exercised with
     constructed pairs whose content tokens land deterministically in
     band
  3. JSON envelope extraction (canonical + top-level `reasoning`
     fallback)
  4. `parse_failed:` / `retry_failed:` prefix stripping
  5. HOLD filter excludes NO_DECISION / BLOCKED / FILLED / SKIPPED rows
  6. Garbage-input total-tolerance — no field type raises
  7. Caller's list not mutated
  8. **No-subprocess / no-claude_call / no-yfinance / no-sqlite3 purity**
  9. Route surface: JSON envelope, `limit` clamp (5..500), broken-store
     degrades to 500 + JSON error (not crash)
  10. **NOT behind `@swr_cached`** — cheap by construction
     (recent_decisions + pure builder, no yfinance / no LLM); locked so
     a future refactor doesn't bring in the prewarm-coverage obligation

**Observational only** (invariants #2/#12 — never gates Opus, never
injected into the decision prompt, no caps). Builder degrades to
NO_DATA on any input failure; route degrades to JSON `{"error": ...}` +
500 on store exceptions (mirrors `/api/shadow-vs-claude` +
`/api/thesis-drift` error-pass-through pattern). Builder lives at
`paper_trader/analytics/reasoning_coherence.py`, route appended in
`dashboard.py` IMMEDIATELY AFTER `/api/thesis-drift` — the two are
now the across-time thesis-stability pair the operator can read
together: position-level vs reasoning-level.

**Naming-collision lesson:** my first scope was `/api/thesis-drift` for
this feature; verified before writing that the route already existed
for a different domain (entry-thesis-vs-current scorecard). Renamed to
`/api/reasoning-coherence` BEFORE writing the builder. **Discipline
pin: always grep the dashboard for the proposed route name + builder
filename before scaffolding** — the analytics surface is mature and the
obvious names are usually taken.

**Verify:** `from paper_trader import dashboard;
dashboard.reasoning_coherence_api` imports OK;
`tests/test_reasoning_coherence.py` 19 / 19 pass; adjacent
`test_thesis_drift.py` (27 tests) + `test_shadow_vs_claude.py` (13
tests) both green — no neighboring regression. **Pre-existing failure**
`test_swr_prewarm_coverage::test_every_swr_cached_endpoint_is_prewarmed`
(missing `earnings-distribution` entry) confirmed on HEAD via
stash-swap — NOT from this pass; belongs to another agent's commit
window and is left untouched per concurrent-agent discipline.

## Feature pass — reasoning themes + decision confidence (2026-05-19)

Two new pure-builder endpoints layered on the existing decision-history
surface. Both descriptive complements to `/api/reasoning-coherence`
(which measures pair-wise Jaccard stability — a *vocabulary stability*
metric) that close gaps in the operator's view of Opus's mental state.

### `/api/reasoning-themes`

**Problem:** the decisions table accumulates Opus's reasoning prose
across thousands of cycles — recurring topics ("earnings premium",
"concentration drag", "memory super-cycle", "macro overhang") and
recurring failure prefixes ("claude returned no response (timeout/
empty)") — but the ~80-endpoint analytics surface has **no vocabulary
distribution** view. `/api/reasoning-coherence` measures pair stability,
`/api/decision-forensics` reads one row, and the dashboard reasoning
panels show the latest blob. None answer "what has Opus been *talking
about* this week?"

**Route** `/api/reasoning-themes?limit=100&top_k=10&include_bigrams=1`
(limit clamped 5..500, top_k clamped 3..50). Pure builder at
`paper_trader/analytics/reasoning_themes.py` reads `store.recent_decisions`,
extracts reasoning text from each row across the three real shapes
(JSON envelope `{"decision": {"reasoning": "..."}}`, top-level
`reasoning` key, bare prose for NO_DECISION timeout strings — the
`parse_failed:` / `retry_failed:` prefix + ```json``` fence stripping
mirrors `reasoning_coherence`), tokenises into content words (length≥3,
non-stopword — the same stopword set as `reasoning_coherence` extended
with prose-glue: `amid`/`against`/`during`/`their`/`them`/`such`/...),
walks the stream to emit 1-grams + (optionally) 2-grams of consecutive
content tokens, then ranks by **decisions_mentioning** (the
breadth-not-loudness contract — a phrase repeated 30× in one verbose
reasoning counts as ONE mentioning decision, but a phrase recurring
across 12 different decisions ranks high). Bigrams and unigrams compete
in the same leaderboard; on a tie the bigram wins (informativeness
tie-break — "super cycle" beats "super" + "cycle"). The example excerpt
is locally anchored (±80 chars around the first hit) so the operator
sees the surrounding context, not a beginning fragment.

**Output:** ranked `themes[]` with `{phrase, decisions_mentioning,
share_of_decisions, total_mentions, first_seen_ts, example, is_bigram}`
+ headline naming the top theme + state in `NO_DATA` (zero rows with
extractable reasoning text) / `OK` (leaderboard emitted) +
`n_unparseable` so the operator can spot a malformed-row spike.

**Locks (`tests/test_reasoning_themes.py`, 20 tests, ~0.8s):**
  1. `NO_DATA` / `OK` ladder + n_unparseable accounting
  2. **Breadth beats loudness** — a 30× repetition in one row does NOT
     outrank a phrase appearing 1× across 5 different rows; the
     discriminating test asserts ranking position AND that `total_mentions`
     is preserved as a *secondary* field (a loudness regression that
     swapped the primary sort key would surface high alpha first)
  3. **Bigram-wins-tie informativeness** — `"super cycle"` outranks
     `"super"` and `"cycle"` at identical (decisions_mentioning,
     total_mentions); a reviewer "consistency-fixing" the sort to prefer
     unigrams fails RED
  4. `include_bigrams=False` strips ALL multi-word phrases from leaderboard
  5. Stopword + len<3 filter applied to BOTH the unigram stream and the
     bigram pairing chain (so "the and for with" produces zero content)
  6. Three real reasoning shapes extract correctly: JSON envelope,
     top-level `reasoning` key, `parse_failed:` prefix
  7. NO_DECISION timeout strings (`"claude returned no response …"`) ARE
     themable as bare prose (the host-saturation pattern surface)
  8. `share_of_decisions` denominator is *parseable rows*, not total
     rows — an unparseable row in window does NOT dilute the share of
     a phrase present in every text-bearing row
  9. Example excerpt contains the phrase literally (case-insensitive)
  10. `top_k` clamps high (>50 → 50) and low (0/missing → 3, not 10 via
      Python `or` short-circuit — explicit `is not None` guard locked)
  11. Caller's list not mutated; garbage row keys never raise
  12. Route surface: limit + top_k clamp, garbage params fall back to
      defaults, `include_bigrams=0/false/no/off` all disable, fresh
      `Store` wiring through `monkeypatch.setattr(store.DB_PATH, …)`
  13. **NOT behind the SWR cache** — cheap pure builder; locked so a
      future refactor can't accidentally bring in the prewarm-coverage
      obligation. Discipline pin from #1 (the literal `@swr_cached`
      docstring lock): the route docstring must NOT contain the literal
      substring `@swr_cached` or the inspect-getsource lock self-trips

### `/api/decision-confidence`

**Problem:** every parseable decision blob carries a numeric
`confidence` 0..1 in the `{"decision": {"confidence": 0.7, ...}}`
envelope. Nothing across the ~80-endpoint surface aggregates it.
`/api/scorer-confidence` is the **DecisionScorer** (the tiny CPU MLP
on the backtest side), not Opus; `/api/decision-forensics` reads one
decision; `/api/reasoning-coherence` measures pair stability — none
answers "is Opus confidently sitting on its hands, or uncertainly doing
nothing?" An operator scanning a paralysed week cannot distinguish
high-conviction HOLDs around a binary event (correct) from low-
conviction churn (a flag to operators that the model is hedging).

**Route** `/api/decision-confidence?limit=100` (clamped 5..500). Pure
builder at `paper_trader/analytics/decision_confidence.py` reads
`store.recent_decisions`, extracts the numeric `confidence` from each
row's reasoning JSON (canonical envelope + top-level fallback +
`parse_failed:` prefix tolerance — same shape ladder as `reasoning_themes`),
computes median / mean / min / max / 4-bucket histogram + per-action
breakdown + recent-vs-older trend split + regime verdict.

**Numerical-robustness contract:**
  * Out-of-band values (`1.5`, `-0.3`) are **CLAMPED to [0, 1]**, not
    dropped. A model emitting 1.2 is bounded conviction noise, not
    invalid data — silently dropping would hide a real model bug from
    the operator. (Discriminator test: `[1.5, -0.5, 0.7, 0.6, 0.8]` →
    `n_with_confidence=5`, `max=1.0`, `min=0.0`.)
  * `NaN` IS dropped (treated as unparseable — the operator sees
    `n_unparseable` go up)
  * Non-numeric (`"high"`, `null`) dropped silently
  * Order of caller's list preserved — `recent_decisions` is newest-
    first, so the FIRST half of the value stream is the *recent* half
    in the trend split (TRENDING_UP = recent half median ≥ older half
    median by `TREND_DELTA = 0.10`)

**Regime ladder** (median confidence):
  * `CAUTIOUS` — median < `CAUTIOUS_THRESHOLD = 0.45` ("Opus is hedging")
  * `NEUTRAL` — 0.45 ≤ median < `CONVICTED_THRESHOLD = 0.70`
  * `CONVICTED` — median ≥ 0.70 ("Opus is decisive")
  Boundary inclusive on the *upper* side: `median == 0.45` → NEUTRAL;
  `median == 0.70` → CONVICTED.

**State ladder** (operator clarity over verdict pressure — the
`reasoning_coherence` / `tail_risk` precedent):
  * `NO_DATA` — zero parseable confidence values
  * `INSUFFICIENT` — fewer than `MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_VERDICT = 5` parsed;
    raw stats (median, mean, buckets) emitted, regime + trend withheld
  * `OK` — verdict emitted

**Output:** state + regime + median/mean/min/max + 4-bucket histogram
(`low <0.4`, `medium [0.4,0.6)`, `high [0.6,0.8)`, `very_high [0.8,1.0]`)
+ `by_action` (per-leading-verb median/mean/n, so the operator can spot
"HOLDs median 0.75, BUYs median 0.42 — Opus buys with less conviction
than it holds") + trend block (`{tag, recent_median, older_median, delta,
split_size}` or None when sample size won't support a split) +
threshold constants in-band for UI rendering. Headline composes the
regime line + a trend appendix when non-FLAT.

**Locks (`tests/test_decision_confidence.py`, 28 tests, ~0.4s):**
  1. `NO_DATA` / `INSUFFICIENT` / `OK` ladder + min-sample gating;
     raw stats emitted under INSUFFICIENT, regime + trend withheld
  2. Three real reasoning shapes extract correctly: envelope,
     top-level `confidence`, `parse_failed:` prefix
  3. **Out-of-band clamp, NOT drop** — the discriminating contract;
     `1.5` → `1.0` in `max`, not absent from `n_with_confidence`
  4. NaN dropped; non-numeric (`"high"`) dropped; `null` dropped
  5. CAUTIOUS / NEUTRAL / CONVICTED at exact threshold boundaries
     (inclusive-upper convention: 0.45 → NEUTRAL, 0.70 → CONVICTED)
  6. TRENDING_UP / TRENDING_DOWN / FLAT by `recent_median − older_median`
     vs `TREND_DELTA`; recent half is the FIRST half of caller-supplied
     order (the `recent_decisions` newest-first contract)
  7. Trend withheld when split half is < 2 samples
  8. Per-action breakdown groups by leading verb (`HOLD NVDA → HOLD` →
     `HOLD`; `SELL_CALL NVDA 200C → FILLED` → `SELL_CALL`); blank /
     None `action_taken` → `UNKNOWN` bucket
  9. Buckets partition [0,1] with no gaps; all 4 keys present (zeroed
     when empty); `very_high` includes exact `1.0`
  10. Garbage-row tolerance — `{}`, `{"reasoning": 12345}`, missing keys
      degrade to `NO_DATA`, never raise
  11. Route: fresh-Store wiring, limit clamp 5..500, garbage param
      `?limit=banana` falls back to default 100, **NOT behind the SWR
      cache** (same docstring-literal discipline as `reasoning_themes`)

**Observational only** (invariants #2/#12 — never gates Opus, never
injected into the decision prompt, no caps). Builder degrades to
NO_DATA on any input failure; route degrades to JSON `{"error": ...}` +
500 on store exceptions. Both endpoints sit immediately after
`/api/reasoning-coherence` in `dashboard.py` so the three across-time
decision-introspection diagnostics (coherence / themes / confidence)
are co-located.

**Applies on next paper-trader restart** (the documented pattern for
every recent feature — the running `:8090` continues until restart).

**Verify:** `from paper_trader import dashboard;
dashboard.reasoning_themes_api; dashboard.decision_confidence_api`
imports OK; `tests/test_reasoning_themes.py` 20/20 +
`tests/test_decision_confidence.py` 28/28 + adjacent
`test_reasoning_coherence.py` 19/19 + `test_core_dashboard_helpers.py` /
`test_core_dashboard_articles_db.py` all pass — no neighboring
regression. Full suite still collects (2657 tests).

## Review pass #32 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-19)

**Agent persona:** debugger + feature dev + live trader; concurrent with
three sibling HYBRID agents (ML+backtest, core, feature-dev).

### Phase 1 fix (commit bdffbf8) — quota-recovery latch retries until delivered

**Bug**: `runner._cycle` cleared `_quota_alert_active = False` *unconditionally*
inside the recovery-notice path, even when `reporter._send` returned False or
raised. Result: a transient openclaw / Discord outage at the moment the quota
recovered silently dropped the "we're back" message AND cleared the latch —
the operator (who only sees Discord) was stuck believing the trader was still
frozen until the NEXT quota outage re-alarmed. The whole point of the latch is
operator-visible state; clearing it without delivery is the failure mode it
exists to prevent.

**Fix**: mirror the alarm-path symmetry — clear the latch ONLY on a confirmed
successful send. A failed send keeps the latch set so the next non-NO_DECISION
cycle retries the notice; the latch itself dedupes so we never spam. Exact
mirror of the original `if reporter.send_quota_alert(detail): _quota_alert_active = True`
asymmetry — both paths now key off the same `bool(_send(...))` contract.

```python
if _quota_alert_active and status != "NO_DECISION":
    ok = False
    try:
        ok = bool(reporter._send("✅ **CLAUDE QUOTA RECOVERED** ◈ ..."))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[runner] quota recovery notice failed: {e}")
    if ok:
        _quota_alert_active = False
```

**Test coverage** (4 new tests in `TestCycleQuotaRecoveryUndelivered`):
- `test_failed_recovery_send_keeps_latch_so_we_retry` — `_send` returns False:
  latch stays True, recovery msg was attempted (operator-visible log line),
  next cycle will retry.
- `test_recovery_send_exception_keeps_latch_so_we_retry` — `_send` raises:
  cycle does NOT propagate the exception (would crash the live loop), latch
  stays True.
- `test_retry_until_success_then_latch_clears` — flaky send: first attempt
  fails, second succeeds. After the second the latch clears and a fresh outage
  re-alarms (the rearm contract).
- `test_successful_recovery_send_clears_latch_unchanged` — regression guard:
  the happy path (single OK send) still clears the latch on the first try.

### Phase 2 feature (commit 9f12f65 + bundled into a028ad5)

**Enriched `/api/portfolio`** — backwards-compatible enrichment of the public
lean endpoint that Digital Intern's dashboard (port 8080) cross-fetches:

Legacy keys (UNCHANGED — cross-port consumers never break):
- `total_value`, `cash`, `starting_value`

New trader-actionable fields, composed *purely* from the already-cached
`portfolio.positions_json` row (no extra store reads, no network — the
endpoint stays the lowest-latency public surface):
- `n_positions` — open lots count
- `open_value` — Σ market_value across open lots (= total_value − cash)
- `unrealized_pl` / `unrealized_pl_pct` — book-wide drift since entry. The
  pct denominator is `total_value` (the equity base) to align with
  `/api/benchmark` / `/api/drawdown` % framing.
- `stale_marks` — count of positions flagged `stale_mark=True` (yfinance
  returned nothing; mark fell back to avg_cost). Nonzero means the
  `unrealized_pl` understates real exposure — explicit so the trader is never
  misled by a phantom "flat" book the `stale_mark` flag was added to expose.
- `last_updated` — ISO timestamp of the most recent mark-to-market write.
  A polling caller can detect "the trader has stopped writing" without
  re-reading equity_curve.
- `pnl_vs_start` / `pnl_vs_start_pct` — absolute and % delta from the $1000
  baseline (`INITIAL_CASH`, invariant #12; never a literal).

**Degrade-safe**: every numeric coercion is try/except so a malformed
`positions_json` row (defensive — `get_portfolio` already falls it back to
`[]`) or a non-numeric `unrealized_pl` degrades to zeros while the legacy
three keys are always present. `total_value=0` yields `unrealized_pl_pct=None`
(no ZeroDivisionError on the synthetic empty case).

**Test coverage** (`tests/test_core_dashboard_portfolio.py`, 13 tests):
- `TestPortfolioApiLegacyContract` — legacy three keys present, CORS header
  intact for cross-port fetch.
- `TestPortfolioApiEnrichedFields` — exact computed values: n_positions /
  open_value summed from cached marks, signed `unrealized_pl` (a +20 and a −5
  net to +15), the % denominator is `total_value` (a divide-by-open_value
  bug would inflate the % whenever cash is high), stale_marks counts only
  flagged rows, pnl_vs_start positive AND negative cases, last_updated parses
  as ISO.
- `TestPortfolioApiEmptyAndDegradeSafe` — empty book, non-list
  `positions_json`, non-numeric `unrealized_pl`, total_value=0.

**Note on commit attribution**: the dashboard.py edit was caught in a
sibling agent's commit `a028ad5` (concurrent-staging race — the
`pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race.md` memory pattern). The test
file lands separately as `9f12f65`. Net: `/api/portfolio` enrichment
is live + locked by 13 regression tests.

### Phase 3 live-validation findings (live trader 2026-05-19 ~04:40 UTC)

1. **Host saturation pathology continues** (#1 known): /api/host-guard reports
   `state=STARVED — 78% of the last 27 decisions never reached Opus`. With
   four concurrent HYBRID Opus agents on the box (≥4 = `opus > MAX_OPUS`
   = saturation), the live trader's pre-flight guard skips most cycles. The
   bot cannot resolve this by trading — it is an OPS problem (`_host_pulse_line`
   in reporter.py routes it to Discord verbatim). NOT a code bug.

2. **NVDA earnings discipline holds**: trader sized 44.5% NVDA + 14.9% TQQQ
   into NVDA earnings (0.8d away). /api/event-calendar surfaces
   `NVDA — earnings in 0.8d [HELD_IMMINENT]`. /api/risk fires MEDIUM
   concentration warning at top1=44.47%. The forward stack works as designed.

3. **Build staleness churn**: /api/build-info reads `stale: true` on average
   within a few minutes of any push (multiple HYBRID agents committing
   concurrently). The git-watcher's deferred restart is honored, but each
   restart kills the in-flight cycle and contributes to the NO_DECISION rate
   (a self-amplifying loop: agents that touch the codebase trigger restarts
   that surface as NO_DECISION metrics). Documented; no code change here.

4. **Discord delivery healthy**: /api/runner-heartbeat `notify.verdict=HEALTHY`,
   `last_ok_ts` within seconds. The 2026-05-17 PATH/shebang outage that
   originally motivated the openclaw fallback resolver remains fully fixed.

5. **Enriched /api/portfolio live**: response shape post-fix:
   ```json
   { "n_positions": 2, "open_value": 593.26, "unrealized_pl": 0.0,
     "stale_marks": 0, "last_updated": "2026-05-19T04:40:01.797701+00:00",
     "pnl_vs_start": 0.0, "pnl_vs_start_pct": 0.0,
     "total_value": 1000.0, "cash": 406.74139404296875,
     "starting_value": 1000.0 }
   ```
   At-a-glance: the trader can confirm "2 positions, exactly at start, marks
   are fresh" in one call rather than fanning out across /api/state,
   /api/equity-freshness, and /api/risk.

6. **Equity integrity OK**: /api/equity-freshness `verdict=FRESH`, no
   portfolio/equity divergence — the live trader and the equity_curve agree
   on $1000.00 ± 0% (the trader memory `pt-portfolio-equity-divergence.md`
   shows this is a temporary mid-cycle artifact, not a bug — confirmed clean
   right now).

### How to run / test (unchanged but locked here)

```bash
# Live trader (foreground; manual launch — see pt-systemd-vs-manual-restart-spam.md)
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
python3 -m paper_trader.runner

# Final import check
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'.'); from paper_trader import signals, reporter, strategy; print('imports OK')"

# Phase-1 regression net (~5s)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_quota_guard.py -v

# Phase-2 regression net (~1s)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_dashboard_portfolio.py -v

# Full suite
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass
- **#10 single source of truth**: `_INITIAL_EQUITY = INITIAL_CASH` — the new
  /api/portfolio `pnl_vs_start` keys off the module constant, never a literal.
- **#12 cross-process value baseline**: `INITIAL_CASH` is the only baseline
  the new endpoint reports against. The legacy `starting_value` key is the
  same constant; consumers that ever switch on it never break.
- **Reporter dedupe symmetry**: the alarm-path "set on success" pattern is
  now mirrored on the recovery path "clear on success" — both keyed off the
  same `bool(_send(...))` contract, so a Discord outage at *either* edge of
  the quota cycle leaves the operator with the truthful state (alarmed if
  outage started, alarmed if recovery undelivered).
- **`pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race.md` discipline observed**: this
  pass's dashboard.py edit was bundled into a sibling agent's commit. Test
  file committed standalone with explicit pathspec; AGENTS.md commit lands
  alongside the test. Never `git add -A` in this tree.

---

### 2026-05-19 review pass — ML+backtest hybrid (Agent 2): per-horizon scorer skill + evaluate_scorer_oos NaN-sentinel parity

**Phase 1 bug fix — `evaluate_scorer_oos` silently coerced null forward returns to 0.0**

`paper_trader/validation.py::evaluate_scorer_oos` used
`_to_float(r.get("forward_return_5d"), 0.0)` to read the realized
target on each OOS record. A row with a missing key, JSON null, or
non-finite (`inf`/`-inf`/`nan`) `forward_return_5d` then defaulted to
0.0 and contributed `(pred - 0.0)**2` to RMSE — fabricating a flat
outcome and biasing the reported skill metric. The sister function
`run_continuous_backtests._oos_rank_metrics` was already hardened with
a `float("nan")` sentinel + `a == a` drop (see
`TestOosRankMetrics::test_records_missing_forward_return_are_dropped_not_zeroed`);
`evaluate_scorer_oos` was the last function still trusting the silent
0.0 fallback. The bug is **latent** on current live data (7,413/7,413
outcomes carry a finite `forward_return_5d`) but the contract was
wrong, and a future writer emitting a null target would silently
inflate the OOS RMSE — pre-fix RMSE on a constructed (1 real + 4 null)
input is ~8.94 vs the correct 0.0.

**Test locks** (2 new tests in `tests/test_validation.py`):
* `test_missing_forward_return_dropped_not_zeroed` — five records,
  four with null/missing/inf/NaN, one well-formed; post-fix `n=1`,
  `rmse=0.0` exactly.
* `test_sell_sign_flip_still_applied_after_nan_filter` — the NaN
  filter must NOT bypass the SELL sign-flip on records it KEEPS.

**Phase 2 feature — per-horizon (10d, 20d) OOS rank-IC + dir-acc in the scorer-skill ledger**

The scorer trains on `forward_return_5d`, but each outcome row also
carries `forward_return_10d` / `forward_return_20d` (the 2026-05-18
multi-horizon instrumentation). Live: 6,300/7,413 outcomes carry 10d
and 6,265 carry 20d. The per-cycle scorer-skill ledger only reported
5d metrics — yet AGENTS.md notes leveraged-ETF strategies have noisy
5d windows but stronger multi-month returns, so a non-trivial signal
at 10d/20d when 5d sits at noise (current state: mean OOS IC ≈ 0.05,
dir_acc ≈ 0.52 across 22 cycles) is the exact research signal a
skeptical quant needs to evaluate the gate's edge.

**Adds**:
* `run_continuous_backtests._oos_multi_horizon_metrics(scorer,
  oos_records, horizons)` — mirrors `_oos_rank_metrics` (same predict
  signature, SELL sign-flip, tie-aware Spearman via
  `calibration._spearman`) but evaluates against `forward_return_{h}d`
  for each requested horizon. Each horizon reports its own `n`
  honestly — a row missing `forward_return_20d` drops from the 20d
  cell only, never poisons the 10d view. Never raises (returns empty
  per-horizon sentinels on any fault — the "scorer-train status must
  stay truthful" discipline, mirrored from `_oos_rank_metrics`).
* Six new tokens in `_train_decision_scorer`'s status string:
  `oos_n_10`, `oos_diracc_10`, `oos_ic_10`, and 20d siblings. Wired
  alongside the 5d tokens so the per-cycle scorer-skill ledger
  automatically carries them via the existing `**parsed` splat in
  `_append_scorer_skill_log`.
* `_parse_scorer_status` extracts the new tokens with a strict
  `(?:^|\s)key=` boundary so the legacy `oos_n=` lookup does **NOT**
  swallow `oos_n_10=`. Old (pre-feature) status strings parse cleanly
  with 10d/20d fields defaulting to `None` (read-side back-compat for
  every historical skill-log row).

**Test locks** (13 new tests in `tests/test_continuous.py`):
* `TestOosMultiHorizonMetrics` (6 tests) — untrained sentinel,
  perfect-rank-ordering at each horizon, per-horizon missing-target
  drop (10d-only row contributes to 10d only), SELL sign-flip parity,
  predict-exception isolation, and the wiring lock that asserts every
  new token appears in `_train_decision_scorer`'s status string.
* `TestParseScorerStatus` (3 new tests) — full multi-horizon parse,
  back-compat for legacy status, and the `oos_n` vs `oos_n_10`
  boundary lock that proves the strict regex prevents substring
  collision.

**Phase 3 quant findings (from running the new metric on live data)**

End-to-end smoke on the deployed pickle (`n_train=3959`,
`(32,16)/alpha=1e-2/early_stopping=True` — matches `MLP_CONFIG`, no
deploy_stale) against the most recent 5,000 outcomes with the
canonical temporal 80/20 split:

| horizon | n | rank_IC | dir_acc |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5d | 1000 | +0.1141 | 0.5516 |
| 10d | 990 | +0.0557 | 0.5592 |
| 20d | 957 | +0.0372 | 0.5350 |

**Finding 1 (decisive):** the scorer's edge is **concentrated at 5d
and decays at longer horizons** — rank_IC halves at 10d and thirds at
20d. The gate's captured then-deployed prediction on the full-history
slice (5,165 captured rows) shows the SAME monotone decay: 5d IC
+0.0471, 10d +0.0189, 20d +0.0136. This is the **opposite** of the
AGENTS.md qualitative hypothesis ("leveraged ETFs have noisy 5d but
stronger multi-month returns"). A future multi-horizon training
experiment cannot assume the longer-horizon target carries MORE
signal than 5d — at the current feature set the opposite holds.

**Finding 2:** the continuous loop appears to have been **DOWN** for
~10 hours at review time — last write to
`decision_outcomes.jsonl` / `scorer_skill_log.jsonl` was 11:06 vs
21:47 inspection. Two `status='running'` rows aged 9.9h and 14.4h
exceed `_reap_orphaned_runs`'s 6h `max_age_hours` guard; they will be
swept to `failed` on the next loop start. Action: confirm loop is
intended down.

**Finding 3:** `_ml_is_qualified()` currently **PASSES** — median
`vs_spy_pct` across the most recent 20 qualifying runs is **+143.33%**
(threshold 0.0%). Qualification is based on **persona-driven backtest
alpha**, NOT on scorer skill (the scorer itself has near-zero OOS
edge). An operator should NOT read advisor-presence as "the scorer
has skill."

**Finding 4:** `baseline_skill_log.jsonl` verdict oscillates by
window: cycles 1–2 → `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL`, cycles 3–4 →
`MLP_ADDS_SKILL`. The 17-feature MLP's edge over a one-line
`ml_score` rule is **borderline and window-sensitive**. The new
per-horizon ledger fields will surface whether this holds at 10d/20d
once the loop runs the next ~10 cycles.

**Finding 5:** the news_urgency / news_article_count propagation is
sound — outcome rows that parse values use them, no-news rows fall
back to None which `build_features` neutralizes to 50/1 (the
documented inference-vs-train parity).

**Finding 6:** 24/501 (4.8%) backtest runs have `status='failed'`,
20 carrying the `[reaped: orphaned running row]` note. Reaper working
as designed.

**Test commands for this domain (Agent-2 scope):**
```
# Phase-1 + Phase-2 changes
python3 -m pytest tests/test_validation.py -k evaluate_scorer_oos -v
python3 -m pytest tests/test_continuous.py -k "MultiHorizon or ParseScorer" -v

# Full ML/backtest regression (the canonical filter)
python3 -m pytest tests/ -k "ml or backtest or scorer or validation or continuous"
```
398 tests pass (up from 389 — 2 new in Phase 1, 13 new in Phase 2).

**Invariants reaffirmed:**
* "Scorer-train status must stay truthful" — every new diagnostic
  block is guarded SEPARATELY so a downstream crash never masks a
  successful train or the previously-reported metrics. The per-horizon
  block degrades to all-n/a tokens on any fault.
* Read-side back-compat — the parser's strict boundary regex keeps
  every historical skill-log row parseable; dashboard panels reading
  the parsed dict get `None` for the new fields on old rows, never a
  KeyError.
* SELL sign-flip parity — `evaluate_scorer_oos`, `_oos_rank_metrics`,
  `_oos_multi_horizon_metrics`, and `train_scorer` all flip the
  realized target sign for SELL actions. Tested across all four
  surfaces now.

**Concurrent-staging hazard observed:** my Phase 2 `git add` was
overwritten by a sibling agent's `git add -A` between staging and
commit — the first commit `a028ad5` carries my message but a
sibling's `reasoning_coherence` files. Re-committed with explicit
pathspec (`git commit -- run_continuous_backtests.py
tests/test_continuous.py`) as `c18e679`, which contains the correct
files. The hazard matches [[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]] in
the agent memory exactly.


## Review pass #33 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-19)

### Phase 1 fixes (commit ef6e9d0) — 4 surgical bugs in the Discord & decision-clock surfaces

1. `reporter._trade_impact_line` SELL "closed" branch emitted
   `closed — cash $X` *and then* unconditionally appended a second
   `cash $X` token, so any full-close where the round-trip lookup
   could not match (caller did not pass `store`, or
   `build_round_trips` raised) produced a duplicated
   `cash $X · cash $X` tail in the trade alert. No test covered this
   path — added two: `store=None` and a `store` whose
   `recent_trades` raises both must produce **exactly one** cash
   token (`body.count("cash $X") == 1`).
2. `reporter._decision_clock_line` was defined but never wired into
   `send_hourly_summary` or `send_daily_close`, so the
   `HOURLY_CONCENTRATION` verdict (the canonical signal that a
   recurring NY hour is being starved by out-of-band Opus jobs) only
   reached `/api/decision-clock` and never Discord. The end-to-end
   test `test_hourly_summary_includes_line_when_concentrated` was
   failing for this reason — fixed by appending `_decision_clock_line`
   after `_position_attention_line` in both summary paths (preserves
   the load-bearing HOST→CAPITAL→ATTENTION→CLOCK ordering: structural
   risks first, drift signals after).
3. `analytics.decision_clock.build_decision_clock` used
   `int(days or 7)` which silently coerced an explicit `days=0` to
   the default 7 instead of clamping to 1. `test_days_clamped`
   `(0, 1)` was failing. Fixed by coercing `None`/non-numeric → 7
   explicitly, then clamping `[1..30]`.
4. `dashboard._swr_prewarm` was missing
   `("earnings-distribution", earnings_distribution_api)` — the
   `@swr_cached` `/api/earnings-distribution` endpoint cold-stalled
   with `{"warming": true}` on first poll after every restart.
   `test_swr_prewarm_coverage`'s "prewarm == @swr_cached" invariant
   locked the gap.

### Phase 2 feature (commit 838ec76) — per-position hold-age on Discord position lines

`_pos_hold_age_token(p, now=None)` reads `opened_at` (always carried
by `store.open_positions()`; absent on the unit-test position dicts
and the persisted `portfolio.positions_json` cache, so existing
assertions stay byte-compatible) and emits a compact `held 42m` /
`held 5h` / `held 3d` token appended in `_portfolio_lines` after the
existing `_pos_pct_weight` parenthetical. Mirrors the `held=Xd`
annotation the Opus decision prompt already shows per position
(`strategy._hold_age_str`) so the operator's Discord surface and the
decision engine see the same staleness signal at a glance.

A 4-day-stuck loser previously rendered identical to a fresh fill in
the hourly / daily Discord summary — the desk's #1 documented
pathology (disposition effect) was visible to the decision engine but
invisible to the operator reviewing the book. Sub-minute returns are
silent (no flicker on a just-opened lot); a future `opened_at` (NTP
step-back — documented clock-skew hazard) clamps to silent rather
than rendering a negative age (the `_fmt_trade_stamp` precedent).
Observational only, no caps (invariants #2/#12 — the `stale_mark` /
`pct-weight` precedent). 11 new tests under
`TestPosHoldAgeToken` cover bucket boundaries, missing / unparseable
/ naive / future fields, and the byte-compat guarantee for the
existing `_portfolio_lines` call sites.

### Phase 3 live-validation findings (live trader 2026-05-19 ~05:38 UTC)

1. **Service is in a systemd-vs-manual restart spam** (known —
   [[pt-systemd-vs-manual-restart-spam]]): the manual orphan instance
   (PID 2502051, PPID 1) holds the singleton flock; the systemd unit
   restarts every 15s, fails the lock acquisition, and exits — 276
   restart attempts in journal. Documented; do not "fix" by killing
   the manual instance, the operator chose this configuration.
2. **77% NO_DECISION rate over the last 35 cycles** due to host
   saturation (known — [[pt-no-decision-host-saturation]]): the
   `/api/host-guard` `pulse.state` reads `STARVED` (probe clear now,
   but intermittent out-of-band parallel Opus jobs OOM-starve the
   live trader). This very review pass is one of the parallel Opus
   sources. Not a code bug.
3. **`_option_expired` UTC-vs-NY same-day-after-close gap** (low
   impact, **not fixed this pass** — see Phase 1 advisor scope
   ruling). For an option whose expiry == today, the comparison
   `exp < datetime.now(timezone.utc).date()` only flips to True at
   UTC midnight, which is 3-4 hours after the actual 16:00 ET close.
   In that window an expired option is marked at avg_cost with
   `stale_mark=True` instead of at `_expired_intrinsic` (worth $0
   OTM or settlement). Market is closed so no trade executes against
   the wrong mark — the impact is one stale-display window per
   monthly expiry on the dashboard. Fix is straightforward (extend
   the signature to take an optional `now: datetime` and compare via
   NY date + same-day close-time check using `market.close_minute`)
   but adds test surface across 6 existing test cases that pin
   `today=date(...)`. Skipped this pass; documented for the next.
4. **`/api/feed-health` HEALTHY** — 419 live articles in 2h, newest
   0.1h old. The digital-intern pipeline is feeding the live trader
   correctly; the NO_DECISION storm is purely Opus-side.
5. **Dashboard responds fast** — 34 ms TTFB on `/` (280 kB HTML).
   `/api/build-info` reports `stale: true, behind: 1` (the live
   process is on `72285ac`, HEAD is `838ec76`) — the git-watcher will
   restart between cycles to apply the Phase 2 hold-age annotation.

### How to run / test

Live trader: managed by `paper-trader.service` (systemd --user) **or**
a manual orphan — current state has the manual instance holding the
flock. To verify after a config change:
```
python3 -m paper_trader.should_restart    # OK / RESTART / OPS_ONLY / ERROR
```

Tests (this pass's scope):
```
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_reporter.py -v          # 166 tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_decision_clock_builder.py -v # 28 tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py -v   # 3 tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v 2>&1 | tail -20               # full sweep
```
2448 tests pass + 1 skipped after this pass (was 2438 before; the
+10 includes the 8 new hold-age tests, 2 new duplicate-cash tests,
and a small overlap with sibling Agent 4's `/api/sector-signal-fit`
additions).

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

* **No `git add -A`** — sibling Agent 2 and Agent 4 were running
  concurrently on the same tree; explicit pathspec on every commit
  ([[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]] discipline). My Phase 2
  commit (`838ec76`) staged only `paper_trader/reporter.py` +
  `tests/test_core_reporter.py`; Agent 4's `/api/sector-signal-fit`
  + analytics file + tests were correctly left out.
* **Reporter additive contract** — every Phase 1 + Phase 2 change
  preserves the existing failure mode: a fault drops the offending
  line, never the whole summary. Locked by the existing
  `summary_still_sends_when_*_faults` tests across multiple
  reporter blocks.
* **Invariants #2/#12** — every new feature is observational only;
  none gate Opus, none add silent caps. The hold-age token is the
  same surfacing trajectory `stale_mark` / `_pos_pct_weight` /
  `_session_block` followed.


### 2026-05-19 review pass — ML+backtest hybrid (Agent 2): SECTOR_MAP coverage fix + live diagnostics

#### Phase 1 (commit: skipped) — no concrete code bugs to fix

After a focused audit of `paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py`,
`paper_trader/backtest.py`, and `run_continuous_backtests.py` against
the deep ML+backtest review history (passes #15–32), no concrete logic
bugs surfaced. The hardening loop (None-coercion guards, atomic
pickle writes, train_scorer dedup, off-distribution gate abstention,
benchmark-honesty notes, FILLED-only training filter, per-cycle
ledgers + trims) has covered every code path I'd otherwise flag.
Set `bugs_fixed=0` per the per-commit guard. Targeted suites stayed
green at the baseline (277 passed across
`test_decision_scorer.py`/`test_decision_scorer_attribution.py`/
`test_scorer_honesty.py`/`test_backtest.py`/`test_ml_backtest_seams.py`/
`test_ml_backtest_coverage.py`/`test_ml_backtest_review.py`/
`test_continuous.py`/`test_calibration.py`/`test_horizon_audit.py`/
`test_ml_live_opinion.py`/`test_attribution_audit.py`).

#### Phase 2 (commit `e691740`) — `SECTOR_MAP` coverage of all 41 unmapped watchlist tickers

The DecisionScorer's 7-way sector one-hot is one of its 17 features.
A coverage audit revealed **35% of `WATCHLIST` (41/118 tickers) had
no `SECTOR_MAP` entry** — all silently collapsing into `sector_other`
alongside Toyota and homebuilders. The scorer could not learn any
sector-conditional pattern for these names: LRCX (semi equipment) had
the same sector encoding as NAIL (homebuilders), and every broad-
index 2x/3x leveraged ETF (QLD/SSO/UDOW/URTY/TNA/...) was
indistinguishable from utility/defense ETFs in feature space.

Added 37 explicit mappings:

- **tech** — semi cap-equipment (`LITE`/`AMAT`/`LRCX`), int'l tech
  ADRs (`BABA`/`SAP`/`SONY`), EV/innovation (`RIVN`/`NIO`/`ARKK`),
  3x broad-index leveraged (`UDOW`/`URTY`/`MIDU`/`TNA`/`WANT`), 2x
  broad-index (`QLD`/`SSO`/`MVV`/`SAA`/`UWM`), single-stock 2x
  (`AAPLU`/`SMCI2X`/`PLTU`/`LNOK`), 2x tech rotation (`USD`/`ROM`),
  3x inverse broad-index — *same correlation magnitude*, opposite
  direction, mirroring the existing `SOXS`/`TECS`/`FNGD` pattern
  (`SQQQ`/`SPXS`/`SDOW`/`SRTY`/`TZA`/`HIBS`).
- **financials** — `BRK-B`/`HSBC`/`SQ`/`FAZ` (last is 3x inverse,
  mirrors `FAS`).

Added an explicit `INTENTIONALLY_OTHER` frozenset (6 tickers:
`TM`/`UXI`/`NAIL`/`DFEN`/`UTSL`/`XLI`) for names whose economic
sector has no enum in `SECTORS` — they correctly remain in
`sector_other` rather than being mis-coupled to tech/financials.

**Invariant locked** by 6 new tests in `TestSectorMapping`:

| Test | What it catches |
|------|-----------------|
| `test_watchlist_coverage` | a new `WATCHLIST` ticker added without an explicit `SECTOR_MAP` entry **and** not in `INTENTIONALLY_OTHER` fails loudly here, instead of silently degrading scorer feature quality |
| `test_sector_map_values_are_valid_sectors` | catches typos like `'techy'` that would yield an all-zero sector one-hot |
| `test_intentionally_other_does_not_overlap_sector_map` | a ticker can't appear in both halves (the intent would be ambiguous) |
| `test_specific_high_value_mappings` | pins `LRCX`/`BABA`/`RIVN`/`QLD`/`BRK-B`/`SPXS` so a "fix" that drops both halves the same wrong way is caught (the coverage test alone would pass) |
| `test_sector_encoding_changes_for_newly_mapped_tickers` | end-to-end proof that `build_features` now puts `LRCX` in the same sector block as `NVDA`, while `NAIL` correctly stays in `sector_other` |
| (pre-existing) `test_all_sectors_in_map` | every declared sector still appears somewhere |

**Pickle schema unchanged** — still 7-way sector one-hot at the same
7 feature slots (10..16). Old pickles still load. The next training
cycle picks up the expanded mapping; the transient cost is one cycle
of slightly off-distribution predictions for the 37 newly-mapped
tickers, and the existing `off_distribution` guard in `_ml_decide`
already abstains the conviction gate on those.

**421 tests pass** under the canonical filter
`-k "ml or backtest or scorer or calibration or continuous or horizon"`.

#### Phase 3 — live quant findings (skeptical-quant perspective)

1. **Continuous loop is NOT currently running.** `ps -ef | grep
   run_continuous` returns no Python process. `continuous.log` last
   touched 2026-05-18 12:03 (~10h stale); the structured per-cycle
   ledgers (`scorer_skill_log.jsonl`, `baseline_skill_log.jsonl`)
   stopped at 11:06 today with only **4 cycles** total ever logged
   on this deployment. A skeptical quant has effectively no live
   training trend to monitor — `skill_trend` / `baseline_trend`
   return `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` against the on-disk ledgers.
2. **Split-brain: `SCORER_PATH` local pkl (n_train=35) vs USB pkl
   (n_train=400).** The decision_scorer module's `SCORER_PATH`
   resolves to `paper-trader/data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl` (local
   filesystem) which carries `n_train=35` from a stub training
   probably done outside the continuous loop. The actually-updated
   USB copy at `/media/zeph/projects/paper-trader/data/ml/
   decision_scorer.pkl` (n_train=400, mtime 21:42 today) is
   **invisible** to every consumer of `DecisionScorer()` — the
   live trader's gate, the backtest engine's `_get_decision_scorer`,
   `/api/scorer-predictions`, all diagnostics. Either path is
   below the 500 gate threshold so the conviction gate (#5) is
   **currently dormant**, but the divergence is a latent footgun if
   either crosses 500 first. Pattern matches invariant #15 (the
   articles.db split-brain) — could merit the same freshness-aware
   resolver eventually.
3. **MLP_ADDS_SKILL verdict appearing in recent cycles** — cycle 3
   ic_gap=+0.069, cycle 4 ic_gap=+0.113 — contradicts the much-
   documented `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` finding from older review
   passes. The anti-overfit `(32, 16) + alpha=1e-2 + early_stopping`
   config (pass #19) appears to have flipped the verdict for cycles
   that train on it; the per-cycle baseline ledger now alternates
   between `MLP_ADDS_SKILL` (recent) and `MLP_NO_BETTER` (early). A
   reading quant should now treat the loop's gate output as
   **marginally useful** rather than reflexively dismissing it —
   though the n=4-cycle sample is too small to call it a regime
   change. `_oos_rank_metrics` corroborates: `oos_dir_acc` 0.52–0.55,
   `oos_ic` 0.09–0.11 across the 4 cycles.
4. **Recent backtest returns are leverage-dispersed, not skill.**
   Median +143% vs SPY over the last 20 complete runs (max +610%,
   min −53%, mean +175%) — heavy 3x-ETF cherry-picked windows.
   AGENTS.md already warns to read `vs_spy_pct` skeptically on
   leveraged windows; live data confirms the warning was correctly
   loaded. The permutation/label-audit validation suite remains
   the only real skill-vs-luck arbiter.
5. **Run 6243 stuck in `'running'` for 4h+** — orphaned by the loop
   death. `_reap_orphaned_runs` would have cleaned it on the next
   loop start (6h age threshold), but the loop isn't running. Two
   total `'running'` rows on disk (the other looks similarly stale).
6. **USB pkl was retrained at 21:42** (≈1h before this audit)
   **after the ledger stopped at 11:06** — so the gate state shifted
   without leaving an audit trail in `scorer_skill_log.jsonl`. The
   most likely cause is a one-shot `run_backtests.py` or manual
   `train_scorer` invocation that bypassed `_append_scorer_skill_log`
   (which is only wired into `run_continuous_backtests.main()`).
7. **24 failed runs (~5%) historically.** Acceptable given GDELT
   rate-limit transients and yfinance flakes visible in the log
   tail, but worth noting for future failure-rate trending.

None of these are quick safe fixes (the loop heartbeat and split-
brain are systemic, not surgical); reported here rather than
patched.

#### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

* **Pickle schema is N_FEATURES = 10 + 7 = 17** (10 numeric + 7
  sector one-hot). The Phase 2 commit changes which sector a ticker
  hashes to but does not change the schema, so old pickles still
  load.
* **`build_features` is the single source of truth for the feature
  vector** — `_ml_decide`, `_compute_decision_outcomes`,
  `feature_contributions`, and `predict_with_meta` all consume its
  output. Adding new sector entries propagates everywhere without
  touching any other call site.
* **`INTENTIONALLY_OTHER` is the documentation-as-code answer to
  "why does this ticker map to sector_other?"** — without it, a
  reviewer could easily mistake a real coverage gap (the 41 silently-
  mapped tickers this pass fixed) for an intentional choice.


## Review pass #34 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-19, ~07:15 UTC)

### Phase 1 — no fixes

Read every load-bearing core file in full
(`runner.py`, `reporter.py`, `signals.py`, `strategy.py`, `dashboard.py`,
`market.py`, `store.py`) plus the recently-touched `host_guard.py` and
`analytics/correlation.py`. The 423 baseline core tests passed cleanly.
A careful trace through the quota-latch flow, singleton-lock degraded
→ recovered transitions, `_window_delta` / `_movers` / `_realized_pl_today`
edge cases, `_extract_tickers` cashtag-vs-bare regex asymmetry, the
`_execute` BUY/SELL/option paths, and `_mark_to_market` stale flagging
turned up no actionable bug. The reporter additive contract held
end-to-end; the host-guard pulse → discord wiring was correct under load.
Per the Phase 1 commit guard, **no Phase 1 commit** — the diff was empty
after the read pass.

### Phase 2 (commit `a5b1d0b`) — SINGLE_NAME_RISK concentration alert in Discord

`/api/correlation` exposes the `SINGLE_NAME_RISK` verdict (top stock-book
weight ≥ `DOMINANT_WEIGHT` = 60%) on the *dashboard* and the
`risk_mirror` block surfaces the same fields to Opus in the *prompt*
(strategy.py `build_risk_mirror` call site). But the operator who lives
in Discord never saw this verdict directly — per-position weight %s in
`_portfolio_lines` exposed the raw number, but nothing flagged the
categorical "this is single-name risk" alarm. The live 2026-05-19 book
sat at NVDA **75%** of stock book — deep in SINGLE_NAME_RISK territory —
with **nothing in any hourly/daily Discord report** saying so. This pass
closed the same dashboard→Discord gap `_capital_pulse_line` /
`_host_pulse_line` / `_position_attention_line` each closed, one
dimension over (capital → host → per-position → name-concentration).

`reporter._concentration_line(store)` composes
`build_correlation` **verbatim** (single source of truth, invariant #10;
same builder `/api/correlation` uses). **Pure store reads only — NO
network** (the Discord-path discipline; `price_history` is intentionally
passed as `{}` so a per-position yfinance hop is never required, the
`_stress_line` / `_recovery_line` / `risk_mirror` no-history precedent).
Computes per-position `market_value` inline (option ×100; stale-mark
falls back to `avg_cost` so a yfinance outage doesn't silently halve the
apparent concentration). Wired into both `send_hourly_summary` and
`send_daily_close` after `_capital_pulse_line` and before
`_position_attention_line` — load-bearing order
HOST→CAPITAL→CONCENTRATION→ATTENTION→CLOCK (structural risks first,
drift signals after, the established #33 ordering).

**Suppression: surface ONLY SINGLE_NAME_RISK.** DIVERSIFIED / MODERATE /
INSUFFICIENT-with-low-top-weight / NO_DATA / empty-headline all stay
silent so a balanced book adds no hourly noise (the `_capital_pulse_line`
FREE-and-not-bleeding precedent — the summary must never become its own
lying green light). The per-position weights in `_portfolio_lines`
continue to show raw numbers regardless, so a non-SINGLE_NAME_RISK book
remains fully diagnosable from the existing lines. The SINGLE_NAME_RISK
threshold uses the builder's own `DOMINANT_WEIGHT` constant (0.60) so
the no-history and OK-state paths land on the same gate.

Failure contract mirrors the rest of `reporter`: any builder/store fault
degrades to `""` ("no concentration line this report"), **never** an
exception ("no Discord summary this report"). Locked by 17 tests in
`TestConcentrationLine`:

* state-ladder suppression (`DIVERSIFIED` / `MODERATE` /
  `NO_DATA` / `INSUFFICIENT`-below-threshold / unparseable-top-weight /
  non-dict / builder-fault all silent);
* OK-state SINGLE_NAME_RISK headline surfaced verbatim;
* INSUFFICIENT-with-dominant-weight surfaces via the weight-based
  fallback synthesis (the buried "verdict withheld" sentence never leaks
  through);
* empty-headline OK-state synthesises a body rather than dropping the
  alarm (defensive against a future builder regression);
* `market_value` uses ×100 multiplier on options;
* `market_value` falls back to `avg_cost` when current_price is the
  default 0 (the stale-mark scenario);
* end-to-end wiring in both `send_hourly_summary` and
  `send_daily_close`;
* whole summary still ships when the correlation builder raises (the
  reporter additive failure contract);
* **end-to-end against the REAL `build_correlation`** with a seeded
  75% NVDA store — this last test is the regression-catch for the
  signature-mismatch bug fixed in `dc49740` (see Phase 3 below).

### Phase 3 — live validation against the running trader (07:08–07:15 UTC)

1. ✅ **`/api/portfolio`** healthy — $1000 equity, NVDA 2 sh @ $222.35
   + TQQQ 2 sh @ $74.28. `stale_marks: 0`. Zero P/L is coincidence
   (market closed, both buys filled at the after-hours close print).
2. ✅ **`/api/runner-heartbeat`** `verdict: HEALTHY`, last decision 1h
   ago, lock acquired by PID 2544540, Discord notify HEALTHY. Decision
   efficacy reads `DEGRADED — 70% of the last 20 cycles were
   NO_DECISION` — expected during this 4-agent concurrent review.
3. ✅ **`/api/correlation`** confirms `SINGLE_NAME_RISK — NVDA is 75%
   of the book` — exactly the case my new feature surfaces in Discord
   on the next hourly cycle.
4. ⚠️ **`/api/host-guard`** `state: SATURATED`, 7 concurrent Opus
   (`>4`), 75.6% starvation rate. The 4-agent review IS the saturation;
   known [[pt-no-decision-host-saturation]]. Not a code bug.
5. ⚠️ **`/api/decision-drought`** `current_drought: PARALYSIS` 3.99h
   long, `alpha_pct: 0.0` (market closed, no alpha to bleed).
6. ⚠️ **`/api/build-info`** `behind: 5` commits. The live runner is on
   boot SHA `f3e3020`; HEAD moved 5 commits forward during this review
   round (sibling agents' commits + my own). The git-watcher's deferred
   restart will trigger on the next cycle boundary.
7. ⚠️ **`/api/supervision`** `verdict: UNSUPERVISED_STALE`, `orphan:
   true` (PPID 1), `systemd: "Failed to connect to bus: No medium
   found"`. The trader runs as a manual orphan; if its git-watcher /
   deadman fires an `os._exit(0)`, there is **no systemd safety net to
   bring it back up**. Known [[pt-systemd-vs-manual-restart-spam]] —
   the operator chose this configuration.
8. 🐛 **My own bug, caught by live validation:**
   `reporter._concentration_line` invoked `build_correlation(sized)`
   with one positional arg, but the builder requires `(positions,
   price_history)`. Every Phase-2 test passed because they all
   monkeypatched `build_correlation` with a lambda accepting `*a, **k`
   — so the `TypeError` was silently swallowed by the outer
   `try/except` and the Discord block dropped every cycle. Fixed in
   commit `dc49740` by (a) passing `price_history={}` (the no-network
   discipline) and (b) keying SINGLE_NAME_RISK off `top_weight_pct ≥
   DOMINANT_WEIGHT` directly so the no-history INSUFFICIENT path still
   surfaces the alarm (the `risk_mirror` weight-based-fallback
   precedent). Added 4 regression tests, including one that exercises
   the **real `build_correlation`** end-to-end against a fresh_store
   seeded to the live 75% NVDA shape — a future signature drift fails
   loudly in CI rather than silently dropping the Discord block.
   Verified live with
   `python3 -c "from paper_trader import reporter; from
   paper_trader.store import get_store; print(reporter._concentration_line(get_store()))"`
   → produced
   `⚠️ **CONCENTRATION** ◈ SINGLE_NAME_RISK\n> SINGLE_NAME_RISK — NVDA
   is 75% of a 2-name stock book — 1.6 effective name(s) by weight.`

python3 -m paper_trader.should_restart    # OK / RESTART / OPS_ONLY / ERROR
python3 -m paper_trader.host_guard        # CLEAR / SATURATED + opus_count + load + swap
```

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

* **No `git add -A`** — sibling agents were running concurrently on the
  same tree; explicit pathspec on every commit
  ([[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]] discipline). Both my commits
  (`a5b1d0b`, `dc49740`) staged ONLY `paper_trader/reporter.py` +
  `tests/test_core_reporter.py`; sibling work was correctly left out.
* **Reporter additive contract** — fault → `""`, never *no summary*.
  The `_concentration_line` `try/except` swallows builder faults; the
  whole hourly / daily-close still ships.
* **Single source of truth (invariant #10)** — the line composes
  `build_correlation` verbatim, never re-derives a top-weight number.
  Even the no-history weight-based fallback reads the SAME
  `top_weight_pct` / `top_weight_ticker` / `effective_positions_naive`
  / `n_stock_positions` fields the OK-headline reads from.
* **Discord-path no-network discipline** — passing `price_history={}`
  preserves the zero-yfinance-call guarantee every recent reporter line
  reaffirms (`_stress_line` / `_recovery_line` / `_capital_pulse_line`).
* **Mock-vs-real test discipline** — every monkeypatch'd test was
  joined by ONE real-builder end-to-end test (the
  `test_calls_real_build_correlation_with_correct_signature` regression
  lock). Phase-3 caught that the original Phase-2 tests had ALL been
  monkeypatched, masking a real signature mismatch; the new
  real-builder test ensures any future signature drift fails in CI
  rather than silently in production.

## Review pass #35 — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-19, ~08:00 UTC)

### Phase 1 — no fixes

Re-read every load-bearing core file in full: `runner.py`, `reporter.py`,
`signals.py`, `strategy.py`, `market.py`, `store.py`, plus the relevant
slice of `dashboard.py`. 418-test core baseline (`test_core_*` + the
already-existing parse-retry + ML opinion suites) green on entry; 521
tests green after the Phase 2 additions. A careful trace through
`runner._cycle` (quota latch / circuit breaker / restart-requested
event), `strategy.decide` (host-guard pre-flight + mid-call re-probe +
Sonnet fallback + JSON-only retry), `_ml_live_opinion` (news-sentiment
+ quant adjustments + regime + watch_px universe gate), and
`_concentration_line` (the pass-#34 addition, intact and live) turned
up no actionable bug. Per the Phase-1 commit guard, **no Phase 1
commit** — diff was empty after the read pass. `bugs_fixed = 0`.

### Phase 2 (commit `5a3cb32`) — lock 3 untested paths in `_ml_live_opinion`

`tests/test_ml_live_opinion.py` covers the documented news-key + tokenization
regressions and quant-only path. Three branches in the function had no
direct lock yet — added as the new `TestRegimeAndUniverseGuards` class:

* **`test_bear_regime_suppresses_borderline_buy`** — locks that the
  `regime_mult` (1.0 bull / 0.6 sideways / 0.3 bear, SPY 20d-momentum
  derived) is actually applied to the score, not just rendered in the
  reasoning label. RSI-25-only NVDA (`adj=+1.5`) buys in bull (1.5 > 1.0
  threshold) but HOLDs in bear (1.5 × 0.3 = 0.45 < 1.0) — the exact
  regime-gating contract.
* **`test_keyword_mapping_picks_up_unticked_article`** — an article with
  empty `.tickers` but `nvidia` / `chip` in the title must still drive
  a BUY via `_WORD_TO_TICKER_LIVE` fallback. This is the canonical
  value-add of the keyword map (extractor misses; keyword recovers); a
  silent regression here would re-blind the advisor to any article
  whose ticker extractor failed.
* **`test_unpriced_ticker_cannot_be_chosen`** — a ticker with
  `watch_px[tk] = None` or `0.0` must NOT be picked as best even when
  its sentiment+quant score is the highest. Without the `px and px > 0`
  guard the engine would emit a BUY for a name the trader cannot
  actually transact (yfinance dead / delisted / off-hours hole).

Staged ONLY `tests/test_ml_live_opinion.py` per
[[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]] — concurrent sibling agents
were running with modified `paper_trader/dashboard.py` and untracked
`paper_trader/analytics/event_readiness.py` in the working tree, all
correctly left out. `features_added = 1` (3 tests in one regression-
locking class).

### Phase 3 — live validation against the running trader (08:10 UTC)

1. ✅ **`/api/build-info`** `boot_sha == head_sha == 5a3cb32`,
   `stale: false`, `behind: 0`. The git-watcher autorestart fired
   between my push and the read — the running trader is on the
   newly-pushed commit.
2. ✅ **`/api/portfolio`** healthy — $1000 equity, cash $406.74,
   NVDA + TQQQ open value $593.26, `stale_marks: 0`.
3. ⚠️ **`/api/host-guard`** `state: SATURATED`, **14 concurrent Opus
   (>4)**, swap **95.3%** (>90% threshold), `mem_available_mb=1535`,
   `load1=24.93`. **77.6% of the last 49 decisions never reached Opus**.
   The 4-agent concurrent hybrid review (this run + 3 siblings, ~14
   Opus subprocesses) IS the saturation. Known
   [[pt-no-decision-host-saturation]]; not a code bug.
4. ⚠️ **`/api/runner-heartbeat`** stuck `warming` (SWR cold) for >5s —
   secondary symptom of dashboard contention under the same host load.
   `/api/portfolio` (smaller payload) replied fine.
5. ⚠️ **`/api/concentration` 404** — concentration is exposed via
   `/api/correlation`, not a dedicated endpoint. Operator surface only,
   no functional impact (the reporter Discord line landed in pass #34
   reaches the operator regardless).

`user_findings = 3`: (a) the saturation pattern remains the dominant
NO_DECISION cause and is operator-resolvable but not code-resolvable;
(b) dashboard SWR cold-path response time degrades sharply under host
load — a 5-second pause to warm `/api/runner-heartbeat` looks like a
dead endpoint to a trader checking by hand; (c) the running trader
auto-deployed my own commit within a minute of `git push` — the
git-watcher deferred-restart path is healthy end-to-end.

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

* **No `git add -A`** — staged only my own file; sibling agents'
  `dashboard.py` / `digital-intern/AGENTS.md` / `event_readiness.py`
  changes were correctly left out of the commit. [[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]].
* **Mature-codebase Phase-1 honesty** — read the full surface, found no
  actionable bug, set `bugs_fixed = 0` per the explicit guard rather
  than manufacturing churn. The honest zero IS the answer when the
  codebase is mature.
* **Edge-case test value-add** — the three new tests don't repeat any
  branch already covered; each locks a distinct path
  (regime / keyword-map / universe-gate) whose silent break would
  degrade the advisor in a different mode.

## ML / backtest review pass (Agent 2, 2026-05-19, 2nd pass)

Hybrid pass against `paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py`,
`paper_trader/backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py`. After the
prior pass on 2026-05-19 (`attribution_audit` + 9+15 new tests) the
diagnostic suite is genuinely saturated — this pass found two real
issues missed by every existing check.

### Bug fix: CONDEMN train-fold weight floor

`train_scorer`'s replication code used
`rep = np.maximum(1, np.round(w_tr * 2).astype(int))`. The `max(1, …)`
floor silently promoted every CONDEMN-annotated row
(`llm_quality_label=-1`, multiplier 0.1×) to rep=1 — the docs claim a
0.1× weight, the measured CONDEMN/unlabeled ratio was ~0.5×. With this
fix rows whose rounded rep is 0 are DROPPED from the training fold
entirely (not floored to 1), so CONDEMN's near-zero weight is realized
in practice. Defensive empty-fold fallback added (impossible in any real
corpus — unlabeled records always weight ≥0.5 → rep≥1 — but keeps
`train_scorer` total-failure-free).

Empirically inert today: 7413/7413 production outcomes carry
`llm_quality_label=0` because `_llm_annotate_outcomes` has failed every
cycle since deployment (no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set — see Phase 3
findings). The fix is correctness-on-future-use: when the auth issue
gets resolved and CONDEMN labels start appearing, they will be down-
weighted as the design intended rather than indistinguishable from a
0.5× weight on a losing run.

Locked by `tests/test_decision_scorer.py::TestLlmWeightReplication`
(3 tests): ENDORSE replicates 3× more than unlabeled (`max(rep)==6`,
`min(rep)==2`); CONDEMN rows are dropped (no `rep==1` floor leakage);
unlabeled rep=2 (×2 scaling pinned). Keeps the ×2 scaling rather than
re-scaling to ×10 — a wider scaling would weaken the unweighted L2
`alpha` term and break the
`test_regularization_suppresses_pure_noise_memorization` guarantee.

### Feature: PKL_REGRESSED verdict in `scorer_freshness.py`

The existing scorer-freshness ladder
(FRESH/INSUFFICIENT_DATA/STALE_PKL/LOOP_STALLED/LOOP_DEAD) reports
`pkl_n_train` and `last_train_n` as INPUTS but no verdict was driven by
their relationship. Observed live (2026-05-19) production state shows
the gap: deployed pkl `n_train=400` while the loop's most recent
skill-log row logged `train_n=3959` — a ~10% corpus, and the gate WAS
acting on it (`gate_active=true`). STALE_PKL does not fire because the
pkl mtime is *newer* than the heartbeat — just clobbered with a tiny-
corpus fit by a side process (manual retrain / out-of-tree script /
agent test that bypassed conftest's `SCORER_PATH` isolation).

`PKL_REGRESSED` fires when:
  - heartbeat is fresh (LOOP_DEAD / LOOP_STALLED take precedence)
  - pkl mtime ≥ heartbeat (STALE_PKL doesn't fire)
  - `last_train_n ≥ PKL_REGRESSION_MIN_TRAIN_N=500` (mutes early-cycle wander)
  - `pkl_n_train < last_train_n × PKL_REGRESSION_TOL=0.5`

Run:
```bash
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.scorer_freshness
```
Exit code mirrors siblings: 0 on FRESH/INSUFFICIENT_DATA, 2 on every
actionable verdict including PKL_REGRESSED.

Locked by `tests/test_scorer_freshness.py` (15 tests — module had **zero
direct test coverage** before this pass): full verdict ladder; CLI
exit-code contract; verdict precedence (LOOP_DEAD wins over
PKL_REGRESSED); below-floor mute; robustness against unparseable JSONL
lines and corrupt pkls.

### Phase 3 quant findings (worth reading)

1. **Production pkl is in a clobbered state.** Deployed
   `decision_scorer.pkl` reports `n_train=400` (mtime 2026-05-18 21:42)
   while the last skill-log row (cycle 4, 2026-05-18 18:06) reports
   `train_n=3959`. Calibration on that pkl: spearman=0.0157
   (MISCALIBRATED) — the gate has near-zero predictive value right now.
   The new PKL_REGRESSED verdict will catch this on the next loop restart
   (currently masked by LOOP_STALLED since heartbeat is 14h+ old).
2. **Continuous loop is currently STOPPED.** No `run_continuous_backtests`
   process; last heartbeat 14h+ stale. Two `backtest_runs` rows remain
   `status='running'` indefinitely. The new freshness check correctly
   identifies this as LOOP_STALLED, escalating with "the conviction
   gate is ACTIVE, so trades are being modulated against this frozen
   model".
3. **LLM annotation has never worked.** Every cycle in `continuous.log`
   shows `[continuous] LLM annotation failed: "Could not resolve
   authentication method..."` because no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set.
   All 7413 production outcomes carry `llm_quality_label=0` — the
   ENDORSE/CONDEMN weighting scheme is inert. The Phase 1 fix is
   ready-for-when-it-starts-working; the auth gap is out of scope.
4. **Effective dedup is ~7%**, not the suspected 95%. Dedup by
   `(ticker, sim_date, action)` on 7413 outcomes ⇒ 6906 unique
   (ratio 0.932); tail-5000 ⇒ 4943 unique. The pkl's `n_train=400`
   anomaly is NOT explained by dedup — confirms the clobber hypothesis.
5. **Recent baseline-skill trend is FLIPPING POSITIVE.**
   `baseline_skill_log.jsonl` cycles 1-4 show:
   `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL → MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL →
   MLP_ADDS_SKILL (ic_gap=+0.07) → MLP_ADDS_SKILL (ic_gap=+0.11)`.
   The historical "MLP is worse than a one-line `ml_score` rule"
   finding may no longer hold post-anti-overfit retune (echoing the
   prior pass's #5 observation). The clobbered pkl currently in
   production interferes with this trend; restart-and-retrain would
   reveal the true state.
6. **Backtest dispersion remains extreme.** 475 complete runs;
   `avg(total_return)=150%`, `avg(vs_spy)=118%`; last 50 runs:
   `avg(total_return)=271%`, `avg(vs_spy)=213%`. This is leveraged-ETF
   beta dispersion through cherry-picked windows, NOT repeatable
   alpha (as AGENTS.md has long emphasized).

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **Read-only diagnostic discipline** — `scorer_freshness` never trains,
  never touches the pickle, no `build_features` / `N_FEATURES` /
  trade-path mutation. Safe to run against the unattended loop.
- **Conftest SCORER_PATH isolation discipline** — the bug class the new
  PKL_REGRESSED verdict catches is precisely "a side process clobbered
  the production pkl by bypassing conftest's monkeypatch". The
  diagnostic exists as a runtime alarm; the test discipline remains the
  primary defense.
- **`train_scorer` honesty contract** — every failure mode (empty
  records, insufficient_after_dedup, null/non-finite forward returns,
  sklearn absent) degrades gracefully. The new CONDEMN-drop codepath
  preserves this with a defensive empty-fold fallback.


## Review pass #36 — paper-trader ML / backtest hybrid (2026-05-19, ~17:00 UTC)

### Phase 1 — no fixes

Read every load-bearing ML/backtest file in full
(`paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py`, `paper_trader/backtest.py`,
`run_continuous_backtests.py`) plus the surrounding diagnostic modules
(`scorer_freshness.py`, `deploy_audit.py`, `calibration.py`,
`baseline_compare.py`, `corpus_audit.py`, `feature_importance.py`,
`gate_audit.py`, `gate_pnl.py`, `skill_trend.py`, `validation.py`,
`persona_leaderboard.py`). Ran the targeted scorer/backtest/continuous
test sweep (170 tests pass in 9.7s; the full `-k "ml or backtest or
scorer"` slice produced 357 pass with one flaky `test_corrupt_pkl_does_not_crash`
that pyc-cache-clears and isolated runs both pass — pytest assertion-
rewriting cache mismatch, not a code bug). The codebase is unusually
mature: every actionable bug class I could identify was already pinned
by a focused test (CONDEMN-drop, FILLED-only training-integrity, dedup
collision under SELL sign-flip, scorer freshness ladder, OOS rank-IC
SELL sign-flip, atomic pickle write, load-cache key by mtime/size).
Per the Phase 1 commit guard, **no Phase 1 commit** — the diff was
empty after the read pass.

### Phase 2 (commit `740c67c`) — scorer_smoke_test diagnostic + 12 tests

`scorer_freshness` answers *is the loop still re-pickling*; `deploy_audit`
answers *does the pickled config match source*. Neither asks the basic
sub-second question: *does `DecisionScorer().predict_with_meta(...)`
return finite, non-degenerate values for a sweep of realistic inputs?*
A model that loaded successfully and matches source config but predicts
the same constant for every input — a degenerate predictor — passes
both existing diagnostics and silently disables the conviction gate at
the predict level (the ±10/±5/0 buckets collapse to one bucket forever).

New module `paper_trader/ml/scorer_smoke_test.py` (~250 LOC) closes that
gap: 8 in-distribution probes spanning the 7-way sector axis + 2 edge
probes (extreme RSI/momentum), each routed through the public
`predict_with_meta` so it describes the EXACT path the live `_ml_decide`
gate uses. Verdicts mirror the sibling ladder:

  * `HEALTHY`              all probes finite, ≥2 distinct buckets       → 0
  * `UNTRAINED`            `is_trained=False` (no pkl / load failed)    → 0
  * `DEGENERATE_CONSTANT`  every probe collapses to one prediction      → 2
  * `BROKEN_PREDICT`       any probe raised or returned non-finite      → 2

CLI: `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.scorer_smoke_test [--json]`. Exit code
mirrors `scorer_freshness._cli` semantics so a cron can branch on `$?`.
Same operational discipline as every sibling diagnostic — read-only,
no train, no pickle/`build_features`/`N_FEATURES`/trade-path mutation;
safe to run against the live unattended loop. Locked by 12 focused
tests in `tests/test_scorer_smoke_test.py` (verdict ladder against
faked scorers, JSON-safety, schema cardinality, CLI exit code).
Verified end-to-end against the deployed pickle: `HEALTHY` with 8/8
distinct predictions and 0/8 off-distribution false positives.

### Phase 3 quant findings — backtest.db live state (2026-05-19)

Using `backtest.db` (475 complete runs, latest 14h ago):

1. **Deployed scorer is critically thin (n_train=35).** The pickle on
   disk reports n_train=35 — far below the 500-threshold the gate
   engages at (invariant #5). The conviction gate is currently a no-op
   regardless of `baseline_compare`/`scorer_smoke_test` verdict.
   Either someone retrained with a tiny test corpus, or the production
   continuous loop hasn't run here long enough to accumulate outcomes.
   A skeptical quant should NOT trust the gate's modulation right now.
2. **Backtest dispersion remains extreme.** Mean total_return=150%,
   median=63%, stdev=267%, range -54%..+2979%. 22% (103/475) of runs
   have negative alpha vs SPY. This is leveraged-ETF beta dispersion
   through cherry-picked random windows, NOT repeatable alpha — the
   long-documented finding.
3. **Two stuck `status=running` orphan rows** (6238, 6243). The 6h-age
   reaper hasn't touched them yet — they are below the threshold.
   `_reap_orphaned_runs` will sweep them on the next mid-loop reap.
4. **17% of complete runs (80/475) had `spy_return_pct = 0.0` without
   the `benchmark_unavailable` note.** The existing guard only fires
   when the SPY series is COMPLETELY empty; runs where SPY exists but
   `returns_pct` returned exactly 0 over a multi-week window (price_on
   walk-back collapsed both endpoints to the same prior close) silently
   produced `vs_spy_pct = total_return` — a fabricated benchmark. SPY
   essentially never has a flat ≥30-day stretch, so a 0 there is the
   same degenerate case as the empty-series branch. **Fixed in commit
   `739e8f4`** (additive note, no behaviour change to returns / winner
   selection / live gate; 30-day threshold prevents false positives on
   short legitimately-flat windows). Locked by
   `tests/test_integration_backtest.py::TestBenchmarkUnavailableNote`
   (degenerate ≥30d window flagged; <30d boundary NOT flagged).
5. **Local environment lacks live training ledgers.**
   `data/decision_outcomes.jsonl`, `data/scorer_skill_log.jsonl`,
   `data/baseline_skill_log.jsonl`, `data/backtest_cache/` do not
   exist in this checkout. The continuous loop is either running
   elsewhere or has not been run here. The deployed pickle (n_train=35)
   is suspicious — it doesn't reflect a real training run through the
   standard `run_continuous_backtests.py` path.

### How to interpret the scorer / backtest ladder

The full diagnostic ladder, in roughly the order an operator should run
on a freshly redeployed pickle:

1. `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.scorer_smoke_test` — sub-second. Verifies
   the pickle even produces finite, non-degenerate predictions for a
   canonical input sweep. Catches DEGENERATE_CONSTANT / BROKEN_PREDICT.
2. `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.scorer_freshness` — verifies the loop is
   still re-pickling and the on-disk pkl matches the heartbeat ledger
   (catches LOOP_STALLED / STALE_PKL / PKL_REGRESSED).
3. `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.deploy_audit` — verifies the deployed
   pickle's fitted-model architecture matches `MLP_CONFIG` in source
   (catches a stale pre-retune net that the loop hasn't retrained
   under the current hyper-params).
4. `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.calibration --oos` — does the model's
   predictions monotonically rank realized outcomes on the temporal
   OOS slice?
5. `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.baseline_compare` — does the 17-feature
   MLP earn its complexity vs a one-line rule? Verdict ladder
   `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` / `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL` / `MLP_ADDS_SKILL`.
6. `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.gate_audit` — is the conviction gate's
   ±10/±5/0 bucketing actually buying realized edge?
7. `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.feature_importance` — permutation
   importance per feature. Catches the "model overfits to the sector
   one-hot, ignores quant signals" failure mode.

### Manual backtest run

```bash
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader

# One-shot 10-run sweep over the default window (legacy launcher)
python3 run_backtests.py

# Long-lived continuous loop (5 runs/cycle, retrain after every cycle)
python3 run_continuous_backtests.py
# Tails continuously; SIGTERM/SIGINT exits cleanly between cycles.
```

### Interpreting backtest results

Per CLAUDE.md §11 and AGENTS.md's longstanding caveats, **do not read
top-line `total_return_pct` as alpha**. The recurring extreme dispersion
(2979% top return, median 63%, stdev 267%) is leveraged-ETF beta through
cherry-picked random windows, not repeatable strategy edge. The
authoritative skill arbiters are:

- `vs_spy_pct` — alpha column, but ONLY meaningful when the
  `benchmark_unavailable` note is absent (after commit `739e8f4` this
  now also catches degenerate spy_return=0 cases).
- `baseline_compare` and `calibration --oos` — OOS rank skill of the
  scorer itself.
- `gate_audit` — realized PnL effect of the conviction gate's actual
  ±10/±5/0 buckets, not the (in-sample-flattering) calibration plot.

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **Read-only diagnostic discipline** — `scorer_smoke_test` never
  trains, never touches the pickle, no `build_features` / `N_FEATURES` /
  trade-path mutation. Safe to run against the unattended loop.
- **Verdict-ladder discipline** — every CLI in `paper_trader/ml/`
  emits a verdict from a fixed public `VERDICTS` tuple, exit 0 on
  benign/insufficient-data, exit 2 on actionable failure. The new
  `scorer_smoke_test` joins that ladder; tests pin the membership.
- **Benchmark honesty (additive notes)** — `run_one` now flags BOTH
  empty-SPY-series AND degenerate-walk-back spy_return=0 cases via
  the same `notes` column. No behaviour change to returns / winner
  selection / live gate; purely informational.

### 2026-05-19 feat (Agent 4 product-engineer pass) — `/api/suggestion-impact`

`/api/suggestions` ranks BUY / ADD / TRIM / EXIT / WATCH ideas but is silent
on the **operational consequence** — a BUY of MU at the default 5%-of-equity
sizing might tip `concentration_top1` past the 40% MEDIUM threshold (the same
threshold `/api/risk` displays) or burn the last cash on hand. The trader
then has to open `/api/risk` *and* `/api/portfolio` and project the impact
mentally before each act. This endpoint does that projection deterministically.

Pure builder `paper_trader.dashboard.build_suggestion_impact` augments each
suggestion with the per-trade projection (each act treated INDEPENDENTLY —
"if I take THIS idea ALONE", which IS the trader's actual decision unit):

- **BUY / ADD**: `projected_size_usd` (default 5% of `total_value`, capped
  at available cash for BUYs with `cash_constrained=true` when capped),
  `projected_qty` (`size / price`), `projected_cash_after`,
  `projected_position_pct_after`, `projected_top1_pct_after`,
  `projected_top3_pct_after`, `projected_severity_after`,
  `would_overconcentrate` (severity LOW → ≥MEDIUM after the act)
- **TRIM (default 50%) / EXIT (100%)**: `projected_proceeds_usd`,
  `projected_realized_pnl_usd` (`(current_price - avg_cost) × qty_sold ×
  multiplier`), `projected_cash_after`, `projected_position_pct_after`,
  `projected_top1_pct_after`, `projected_top3_pct_after`,
  `projected_severity_after`, `frees_concentration` (severity ≥MEDIUM → LOW
  after the act, or HIGH → MEDIUM)
- **HOLD / WATCH**: pass-through with `would_act: false` (no projection
  fields). The baseline still surfaces so the UI doesn't have to merge two
  endpoints.

**SSOT — single concentration taxonomy.** The projected severity comes from
the SAME `_concentration_severity` helper `/api/risk` uses; the per-position
rows come from the SAME `_classify` + `_LEVERAGE_BETA` constants. A trader
who reads "projected HIGH after BUY" here sees the same `concentration_warning`
on `/api/risk` after the act. No second threshold table to drift.

**Route** `/api/suggestion-impact?size_pct=5` (clamped 0..100, default 5.0).
SWR-cached 45s (matches the `/api/suggestions` cache lifecycle — the impact
view re-derives only when suggestions do). Re-uses `suggestions_api()`'s JSON
output as input so the contract follows automatically if the suggestions
shape evolves.

**Locks (`tests/test_suggestion_impact.py`, 17 tests, ~1.6s):**
  1. Empty / non-list inputs collapse to a well-formed envelope (never raise)
  2. `size_pct` parameter overrides the default 5% sizing
  3. BUY uses 5%-of-equity sizing when cash is sufficient
  4. BUY caps at available cash and flags `cash_constrained`
  5. BUY pushes severity through the SAME `_concentration_severity` buckets
     `/api/risk` displays (LOW → MEDIUM via the 40%-top1 threshold)
  6. BUY into an unheld ticker creates a new row in the projection
  7. EXIT projects full liquidation; realized P/L = `(current - avg_cost) × qty`
  8. TRIM defaults to 50% (matches the `_SUGGESTION_TRIM_FRACTION` constant)
  9. `frees_concentration` fires when EXIT drops severity HIGH → LOW
 10. Realized P/L is negative when current < avg_cost
 11. HOLD / WATCH pass through with `would_act: false` and no projection keys
 12. SSOT proof: projected severity through the builder agrees with calling
     `_concentration_severity` directly
 13. Flask route exists, clamps `size_pct` to 0..100, tolerates garbage

**Live evidence at rollout:** with NVDA at 44.47% of book (MEDIUM severity)
and $406.74 cash, a BUY card for MU at default 5% sizing ($50 → 0.07 shares
at $681) projects severity unchanged at MEDIUM (top1 stays NVDA, top3 barely
moves), so the trader can act without re-opening the risk panel.

Advisory only — never gates Opus, never sizes an actual trade, never enters
the decision prompt (invariants #2 / #12). **No UI card yet** (consumers
query the route; natural home is the live trader page's existing
suggestions panel as a per-card expand).


### 2026-05-19 review pass (paper-trader core hybrid · `closed_positions` realized-P/L correctness · post-trade summary stats · live findings)

`Store.closed_positions` (the data source for `/api/closed-positions` and
the `closed-positions` summary card) was systematically computing the
wrong realized P/L for **every** closed lot — but the bug was silent
because no trade had closed since the endpoint was added. Two distinct
failures stacked:

1. **The opening BUY was always excluded from the window.** The SQL
   filter was `timestamp >= opened_at`, but `record_trade` runs *before*
   `upsert_position` in `strategy._execute`, so the opening BUY's trade
   timestamp lands a few microseconds *before* the position row's
   `opened_at`. Observed in the live DB:
   - NVDA trade ts `02:56:34.147236`, position opened_at `.150387` → 3.15 ms gap
   - TQQQ trade ts `00:42:15.202798`, position opened_at `.203088` → 290 µs gap
   The window therefore skipped every opening BUY and `realized_pl`
   reported only the gross SELL proceeds with no cost deducted — wildly
   overstating every winner and silently zeroing every breakeven.

2. **The action filter missed option round-trips.** The exact-match list
   `("SELL","CLOSE","SELL_TO_CLOSE")` / `("BUY","OPEN","BUY_TO_OPEN")`
   never matched the live trader's `BUY_CALL` / `BUY_PUT` / `SELL_CALL`
   / `SELL_PUT` actions. Even when (1) was fixed, every option close
   would have read **$0 realized** regardless of strike or exit price.

The new `closed_positions` walks every trade for the lot's
`(ticker, type, expiry, strike)` key chronologically and identifies the
round-trip whose close lands at or before `closed_at` (held qty starts
at 0, BUYs add, SELLs subtract, every return-to-≈0 closes a round-trip
slice — the same `round_trips.py` walk pattern, single source of truth
#10 in spirit). The slice's BUY/SELL legs are summed with
`startswith("BUY")` / `startswith("SELL")` so every documented action
contributes, and the per-lot output now additionally carries `cost`,
`proceeds`, `realized_pl_pct`, `hold_seconds`, `hold_days`.

**Feature complement** (`/api/closed-positions` summary, the natural
post-mortem panel a trader reads after the bell):

- `total_cost` / `total_proceeds` — gross BUY / SELL dollar flow
- `avg_realized_pl_pct` — **cost-weighted** realized / cost across the
  slice. A simple mean of per-lot percentages would over-weight a $10
  lot up 100% against a $1000 lot down 5% (the test
  `test_cost_weighted_avg_differs_from_simple_mean` pins exactly this:
  a real-dollar mixed slice that the cost-weighted figure reports as
  NEGATIVE while a naive mean would report +47.5%)
- `avg_winner_pct` / `avg_loser_pct` — un-weighted mean inside each
  bucket so both edges of the payoff ratio remain visible (None when
  the bucket is empty)
- `median_hold_days` — median per-lot hold_days, None when no lot has
  a parseable opened_at/closed_at pair

Observational only — never gates Opus, never injected into the decision
prompt, no caps (invariants #2/#12 — the existing `/api/closed-positions`
contract). Pure builder; any unparseable timestamp degrades to None /
zero and never raises (the `_hold_duration` precedent).

**Locks**:
- `tests/test_core_store.py::TestClosedPositionsRealizedPL` (9 tests):
  stock winner, stock loser, option round-trip pinning ($0 regression),
  put round-trip losing, partial-then-full close, `hold_duration`
  helper round-trip + bad-input degrade-safe, summary newest-first
  ordering
- `tests/test_core_dashboard_portfolio.py::TestClosedPositionsApiSummary`
  (5 tests): empty-book null aggregates, one-winner-one-loser exact
  W/L/pct, per-lot `realized_pl_pct` present, cost-weighted vs simple-
  mean divergence, median_hold_days present + non-negative

**Live findings (this pass)**:
1. `closed_positions` realized P/L was wrong for every closed lot —
   bug surfaced via the lack of any test that exercised the documented
   action filter against the live trader's actual action strings
   (BUY_CALL/SELL_CALL never matched). The fix lands the new
   walk-trades-chronologically logic with regression tests.
2. The live runner is **UNSUPERVISED** at the moment of this pass —
   `/api/supervision` reports `verdict: UNSUPERVISED, orphan: true,
   ppid: 1`. Pre-existing operational state (not a code bug); a clean
   exit (git-watcher restart / deadman) would leave the trader DOWN.
   Recommendation lifted from `/api/supervision`: `systemctl --user
   enable --now paper-trader`.
3. The `git-watcher` self-restart path is **verified working live**
   during this pass — the runner booted on `e594450` and auto-restarted
   onto my `15bee44` commit (current `head_sha`), serving the new
   summary fields within ~60s of the push. The auto-deploy contract
   documented in `runner.py` is intact.

Applies to existing data immediately — no schema change. `/api/closed-
positions` was already gated behind `?limit=N`; new fields are purely
additive.


## ML / backtest review pass (Agent 2, 2026-05-19, 3rd pass) — gate-bucket diversity

Hybrid pass against `paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py`,
`paper_trader/backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py` after the prior
two 2026-05-19 passes already saturated the bug-fix surface. No new bug
fixes were warranted this cycle (Phase 1 commit guard cleanly skipped);
the value of this pass is in the smoke-test feature add plus 7 Phase 3
quant findings.

### Feature: `GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE` verdict + per-bucket histogram in `scorer_smoke_test.py`

The existing `DEGENERATE_CONSTANT` verdict compares predictions at
`_CONSTANT_TOLERANCE_PCT = 1e-4` raw-magnitude tolerance — a scorer
producing 8 distinct predictions of 0.5%, 1.2%, 2.0%, 4.5% etc. (all
inside the conviction gate's neutral `[0, 5]` arm) cleanly clears that
check and verdicted HEALTHY despite **the conviction gate being
operationally dormant on those inputs**. Every BUY through that
deployed model ends up with the same `×1.0` multiplier regardless of
the model's "prediction" because none cross the gate's `±10 / ±5 / 0`
thresholds. This is the same failure pattern the prior `n_train=400`
clobber documented in review pass #2 produced live (calibration
spearman=0.0157 / MISCALIBRATED, gate near-zero predictive value).

`_gate_bucket(pred: float) -> str` is the lockstep mirror of
`_ml_decide`'s four-arm ladder (`paper_trader/backtest.py`):

| pred range            | label              | gate multiplier |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------:|
| `p < -10`             | `strong_headwind`  | `×0.6`          |
| `-10 ≤ p < 0`         | `mild_headwind`    | `×0.85`         |
| `0 ≤ p ≤ 5`           | `neutral`          | `×1.0` (no-op)  |
| `5 < p ≤ 10`          | `mild_tailwind`    | `×1.15`         |
| `p > 10`              | `strong_tailwind`  | `×1.3`          |

The mirror is pure / total / NaN-safe (a non-finite or non-numeric
prediction falls through to `neutral`, the no-op arm — a diagnostic
crash can never propagate from this helper to a verdict) and uses
strict comparators that exactly match `_ml_decide`'s `< -10` / `< 0` /
`> 10` / `> 5` chain at every boundary.

The smoke report gains:
- `gate_bucket_counts: {strong_headwind:int, mild_headwind:int,
  neutral:int, mild_tailwind:int, strong_tailwind:int}` — every
  documented arm pre-populated to `0` so dashboard / Discord templates
  never `KeyError` on an absent arm.
- `distinct_gate_buckets: int` — the count of arms with at least one
  probe.

Verdict precedence: `BROKEN_PREDICT` > `DEGENERATE_CONSTANT` >
`GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE` > `HEALTHY`. The constant check (a strictly
stronger fail than gate-bucket collapse) takes precedence so an
operator reading "DEGENERATE_CONSTANT" knows it is also a gate-collapse
case, but a "GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE" specifically tells them the model
varies but the gate is dormant — different actionable surfaces.

CLI:
```bash
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.scorer_smoke_test
```
Now prints the bucket histogram inline (`strong_headwind=0
mild_headwind=2 neutral=5 mild_tailwind=1 strong_tailwind=0` for the
deployed `n_train=35` pkl at the time of this pass) and a per-probe
`gate=<arm>` label. Exit code 2 on `GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE` mirrors
the other actionable verdicts (cron contract preserved).

Locked by `tests/test_scorer_smoke_test.py` (10 new tests, 24 total,
~1.4s):

`TestGateBucket` (6 tests) — pins every arm boundary:
- `strong_headwind` strictly below `-10` (boundary `-10.0` falls into
  `mild_headwind` per `_ml_decide`'s `< -10` strictness)
- `mild_headwind` strictly negative (boundary `0.0` is `neutral` per
  `_ml_decide`'s `< 0` strictness)
- `neutral` INCLUSIVE on both ends of `[0, 5]` (matches `_ml_decide`'s
  branchless fall-through chain)
- `mild_tailwind` strictly above `5` (boundary `10.0` stays in
  `mild_tailwind` per `_ml_decide`'s `> 10` strictness)
- `strong_tailwind` strictly above `10`
- NaN / `None` / non-numeric inputs fall through to `neutral`

`TestGateBucketsDegenerate` (6 tests):
- Neutral-only `_NeutralBucketScorer` (8 distinct preds, all in
  `[0.5, 4.5]`) verdicts `GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE` — the exact failure
  pattern review pass #2 catches via `PKL_REGRESSED` AFTER the loop
  restarts; this verdict catches it BEFORE.
- Two-bucket boundary (exactly 2 arms populated) still HEALTHY (≥ 2,
  not > 2 — inclusive boundary).
- `gate_bucket_counts` includes every documented bucket key (zeros
  filled in for absent arms; JSON-schema lock).
- Sum across all bucket counts equals `n_probes` — no probe lost,
  none double-counted.
- DEGENERATE_CONSTANT takes precedence over GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE
  (the stronger fail wins for diagnostic precision).
- Off-distribution scorer with predictions in ONE bucket still
  verdicts GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE (off-dist alone doesn't save it).
- CLI exit code 2 for GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE (cron contract).

`TestSchema::test_module_level_constants_are_stable` updated to lock
the 5-verdict cardinality (was 4) and the `_GATE_BUCKETS` tuple
ordering (headwind → neutral → tailwind, matching the `_ml_decide`
ladder for left-to-right histogram rendering).

### Phase 3 quant findings (worth reading)

1. **Continuous loop is STOPPED.** Last skill-log heartbeat
   `2026-05-18T18:06:04+00:00` (cycle 4), `continuous.log` mtime
   `2026-05-18 12:03 PDT`. The loop has been dead ~14h at the time of
   this pass. 2 `backtest_runs` rows remain `status='running'` (6238,
   6243) — the per-cycle reap-on-startup will clean them when the loop
   restarts (`_reap_orphaned_runs` with 6h age guard).
2. **The deployed pickle is in PKL_REGRESSED state.** Live read:
   `n_train=35` in `data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl`. The last skill-log
   row (cycle 4) recorded `train_n=3959`. Ratio is `0.009` — well
   below the `PKL_REGRESSION_TOL=0.5` threshold review pass #2 added
   detection for. The `_ml_decide` conviction gate is INACTIVE
   (`_scorer_n >= 500` is False) so live trading is unaffected; the
   smoke test's new verdict ladder would correctly verdict HEALTHY on
   the *predictions* (3/5 gate buckets populated, sane spread) but the
   `n_train=35` makes the gate operationally inert regardless.
3. **Production data directories are SPLIT across two on-disk
   locations.** The continuous loop writes JSONL ledgers to
   `/media/zeph/projects/paper-trader/data/` (USB mount). The current
   working directory `/home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader/`
   (the monorepo path) has `backtest.db` symlinked to USB but **no
   symlink for `data/`** — so `decision_outcomes.jsonl`,
   `winner_training.jsonl`, `scorer_skill_log.jsonl`, and
   `baseline_skill_log.jsonl` are NOT visible from this working tree.
   Any operator-run diagnostic from the monorepo path
   (`calibration` / `baseline_compare` / `scorer_freshness`) returns
   "no outcomes file" / `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` despite the production
   data existing on USB. This is an out-of-scope deployment issue;
   diagnostics themselves are correct, the path mismatch is the bug.
4. **Stale code on USB.** `/media/zeph/projects/paper-trader/`
   (where the production loop runs) has `paper_trader/ml/
   decision_scorer.py` mtime `2026-05-17 00:36`, while the monorepo
   path has it at `2026-05-19 00:48`. The production loop runs ~2-day-
   stale code. Out-of-scope deployment issue; flagged here so a future
   restart picks up the current head.
5. **Documented OOS skill plateau is stable.** Last four skill-log
   rows (cycle 1-4 of the most recent loop instance):
   `val_rmse ∈ {7.3, 12.9, 11.4, 10.9}`, `oos_rmse ∈ {11.0, 11.8,
   12.7, 14.1}`, `oos_dir_acc ∈ {0.52, 0.53, 0.52, 0.55}`, `oos_ic ∈
   {0.08, 0.09, 0.09, 0.11}`. The mild val<<oos gap is the documented
   modest-overfit; rank-IC of 0.08-0.11 / dir-acc 0.52-0.55 is barely
   above coin-flip, consistent with prior passes' "modest but real
   skill" reading. `gate_active=true` and `deploy_stale=false` on every
   row — when the loop was running, the gate was being trusted on a
   net that matches source config.
6. **Smoke test against the deployed (clobbered) pickle: HEALTHY,
   3/5 gate buckets populated.** Predictions span `-9.4%` (UNH
   healthcare_weak) to `+5.3%` (AAPL tech_overbought), all
   in-distribution (no probe clamped). No probe lands in
   `strong_headwind` (`< -10%`) or `strong_tailwind` (`> +10%`) — even
   the extreme-overbought edge probe predicts modestly. This is a
   genuinely useful operator signal added by this pass: the gate's
   tail arms are dormant on typical inputs to the deployed model.
7. **No bugs warranted Phase 1 fixes.** The prior two 2026-05-19
   review passes (CONDEMN floor + `PKL_REGRESSED`) saturated the
   bug-fix surface; the remaining failure-mode gap was the gate-bucket
   diversity check shipped above.

```

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **`_gate_bucket` lockstep with `_ml_decide`.** A drift between the
  two would silently produce wrong `GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE` verdicts;
  the boundary tests (every comparator pinned) catch it.
- **Read-only diagnostic discipline.** `scorer_smoke_test` still
  never trains, never touches the pickle, no `build_features` /
  `N_FEATURES` / trade-path mutation. The new bucket histogram is
  pure post-processing of predictions already produced by the
  existing probe sweep.
- **Schema additivity.** Existing `gate_bucket_counts` /
  `distinct_gate_buckets` consumers see no JSON-schema break; older
  callers that just read `verdict` / `probes` are byte-unaffected.


## ML / backtest review pass (Agent 2, 2026-05-19, 4th pass) — leveraged-vs-non-leveraged scorer-skill audit

Hybrid pass against `paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py`,
`paper_trader/backtest.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py` after the
prior three 2026-05-19 passes saturated the bug-fix surface (CONDEMN
floor + `PKL_REGRESSED` + `GATE_BUCKETS_DEGENERATE` already shipped).
Phase 1 commit guard cleanly skipped this cycle (no concrete bugs);
value is in the new `leveraged_skill` diagnostic plus 7 Phase 3 quant
findings.

### Phase 2 (commit `7abd09a`) — `leveraged_skill.py` per-bucket OOS skill audit

The skeptical-quant gap left open by every existing OOS audit module.
Production `data/decision_outcomes.jsonl` is empirically **35.3%
leveraged ETFs** — SOXL alone = 12.6%, TQQQ = 9.6%. The live BUY
conviction-gate (`_ml_decide` line ~1655) acts on the SAME
`predict()` output for both classes through one ladder (±10/±5/0).
If the scorer's apparent `oos_ic` is carried by leveraged-ETF beta
amplification (a strong-trending bull window predictably pushes
TQQQ/SOXL up 5–15% in 5 trading days regardless of news/quant
features), then gating on the SAME predictions for a non-leveraged
BUY is gating on noise.

`sector_skill` cannot answer this question — it groups SOXL, TQQQ,
NVDA, AAPL all under "tech", collapsing the leveraged ETFs and their
underliers into one bucket whose IC is dominated by the leveraged
tail. `persona_skill` is orthogonal (persona ≠ leverage class).
`baseline_compare` is silent on subset breakdown.

`leveraged_skill` splits the OOS slice strictly on `ticker IN
_LEVERAGED_ETFS` (the SAME constant `_ml_decide` uses for the
elevated 40% conviction cap, imported — not redefined — so a future
edit to that set shifts every consumer in lockstep) and reports
per-bucket `n_train`, `n_oos`, `mean_pred`, `mean_realized`,
`magnitude_bias`, `rmse`, `dir_acc`, `rank_ic`. Verdict ladder:

| Verdict | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` | < `MIN_RECORDS=30` aligned OOS rows total |
| `SCORER_UNTRAINED` | `is_trained=False` |
| `HAS_INVERTED_BUCKET` | any bucket `rank_ic ≤ -IC_GOOD=0.15` |
| `LEVERAGED_ONLY_EDGE` | leveraged ≥ SIGNAL_EDGE AND non-leveraged < WEAK_SIGNAL_EDGE |
| `NONLEVERAGED_ONLY_EDGE` | non-leveraged ≥ SIGNAL_EDGE AND leveraged < WEAK_SIGNAL_EDGE |
| `LEVERAGED_DOMINATES` | both have edge, `(ic_lev − ic_non) ≥ IC_DOMINANCE_GAP=0.10` |
| `BALANCED_EDGE` | both have edge, gap < `IC_DOMINANCE_GAP` |
| `NO_EDGE` | neither bucket reaches `WEAK_SIGNAL_EDGE` |

Per-bucket ladder (`SPARSE` / `INVERTED_SIGNAL` / `SIGNAL_EDGE` /
`WEAK_SIGNAL_EDGE` / `NO_SIGNAL_EDGE`) mirrors `sector_skill`'s
exactly — thresholds (`IC_MIN=0.05`, `IC_GOOD=0.15`,
`MIN_OUTCOMES_PER_BUCKET=20`) are intentionally aligned so a quant
reading both diagnostics sees one consistent ladder.

CLI: `python3 -m paper_trader.ml.leveraged_skill [--json]`.
Exit-code contract:
- `0` — `BALANCED_EDGE` / `NONLEVERAGED_ONLY_EDGE` / `NO_EDGE` /
  `LEVERAGED_DOMINATES` / `LEVERAGED_ONLY_EDGE` / `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
- `1` — `SCORER_UNTRAINED` / other recoverable error
- `2` — `HAS_INVERTED_BUCKET` (cron-actionable; the gate is harmful
  in that bucket)

Reuses `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` (same temporal holdout
the scorer-skill ledger uses) and `calibration._spearman` (tie-aware,
load-bearing because `PRED_CLAMP_PCT` ties off-distribution preds at
±50). Read-only, never raises, never touches `decision_scorer.pkl` /
`build_features` / `N_FEATURES` / trade path — safe under the live
unattended continuous loop.

Locked by `tests/test_leveraged_skill.py` (34 tests, ~0.8s):
- `TestBucketOf` (4 tests) — leveraged/non assignment, lowercase
  normalisation, None/empty
- `TestVerdictForBucket` (5 tests) — every per-bucket boundary pinned
- `TestAlignedOosPair` (4 tests) — missing fwd_5d / NaN / SELL
  sign-flip / scorer exception
- `TestBucketMetrics` (4 tests) — perfect/zero correlation, magnitude_bias
- `TestVerdictsTuple` + `TestSchema` (3 tests) — VERDICTS cardinality
  lock (8 verdicts), JSON-safety
- `TestOverallVerdicts` (7 tests) — every overall verdict reached
  exactly once on staged synthetic data
- `TestLeveragedDominates` (1 test) — IC gap exceeds threshold case
- `TestTrainCountSurfacing` (1 test) — per-bucket `n_train` exposed
- `TestAnalyzeCli` (5 tests) — analyze degrade-safe + CLI JSON/table
  + exit-code 2 on `HAS_INVERTED_BUCKET`

### Phase 3 quant findings (worth reading)

1. **Continuous loop is STOPPED.** Last `scorer_skill_log.jsonl`
   heartbeat `2026-05-18T18:06:04+00:00` (cycle 4), `continuous.log`
   mtime `2026-05-17`. Loop dead ≥14h at time of this pass. Same
   state the prior pass observed; no recovery between. 2 stuck
   `status='running'` rows on USB backtest.db (6238 from 14:17,
   6243 from 18:45); 6238 is >6h old so the per-cycle reaper will
   sweep it on restart.
2. **Deployed pickle remains in PKL_REGRESSED state.** Local read:
   `n_train=35` in `data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl`. Last skill-log
   row (cycle 4 of the most recent loop instance) recorded
   `train_n=3959`. Ratio `0.009` ≪ `PKL_REGRESSION_TOL=0.5` — the
   gate is OPERATIONALLY INERT (`_scorer_n >= 500` False); live
   trading unaffected. Same critical-thin state two prior passes
   documented.
3. **Outcomes corpus is 35.3% leveraged ETFs.** SOXL=12.6%,
   TQQQ=9.6%, UPRO/TECL/FNGU/CURE/LABU/NAIL/DPST/FAS the rest.
   This is exactly the asymmetry the new `leveraged_skill`
   diagnostic exists to surface: the scorer is trained heavily on
   leveraged-ETF forward returns whose 5d distribution has very
   different statistical properties than the single-name underliers.
4. **`leveraged_skill` on a 1500-row subsample of the production
   corpus surfaces HAS_INVERTED_BUCKET against the deployed (n=35
   clobbered) pickle.** `nonleveraged` rank_ic=+0.181 SIGNAL_EDGE,
   `leveraged` rank_ic=-0.205 INVERTED_SIGNAL — the deployed
   tiny-model's predictions are anti-predictive on leveraged ETFs
   AND weakly skilled on non-leveraged names. Of course `n_train=35`
   < 500 so the gate is inactive; this demonstrates the diagnostic
   reads a genuine asymmetry the headline `oos_ic` cannot show. The
   verdict on the FULL n=3959 production pickle will likely differ
   — re-run when the loop restarts and lifts the deployed model
   back above the gate threshold.
5. **Historical gate-decision capture: 5165/7413 rows (69.7%) carry
   a non-null `gate_scorer_pred` from the loop's then-deployed
   model.** Mean=+1.72%, stdev=7.31%. Bucket histogram:
   `strong_headwind=4.3% | mild_headwind=29.7% | neutral=43.3% |
   mild_tailwind=14.5% | strong_tailwind=8.3%`. The conviction
   modulation was historically weighted toward the headwind side
   (34.0% headwind vs 22.8% tailwind), so the gate cut conviction
   more often than it amplified. 4 off-distribution abstentions —
   the gate skipped modulation cleanly when the scorer flagged
   off-dist (the documented `(off-dist,gate-skipped)` marker).
6. **Baseline_compare verdict trajectory (cycles 1-4 of the most
   recent loop instance): cycle 2 `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL` →
   cycles 3-4 `MLP_ADDS_SKILL`.** Latest cycle 4: `mlp_rank_ic=0.192`,
   best baseline (`rsi_meanrev`) IC=0.079, `ic_gap=+0.113`. The
   skill ledger headline `oos_ic=0.11` agrees with `mlp_rank_ic` by
   construction. The MLP is BEATING a one-line rule in the most
   recent cycle, contradicting the long-standing
   `MLP_NO_BETTER_THAN_TRIVIAL` finding — worth re-evaluating once
   the loop restarts and accumulates more cycles.
7. **Production data directories remain SPLIT** across the monorepo
   path (this checkout) and `/media/zeph/projects/paper-trader/`.
   `data/` is not symlinked here — `decision_outcomes.jsonl`,
   `scorer_skill_log.jsonl`, `baseline_skill_log.jsonl` are not
   visible from the monorepo working tree, so `analyze()` against
   the default path returns `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. Out-of-scope
   deployment issue; flagged in the prior pass too. Operators must
   either symlink or pass an explicit `outcomes_path=` to invoke
   any diagnostic from this checkout.

```

### How to interpret the leveraged-skill ladder

A `BALANCED_EDGE` verdict says the scorer's `rank_ic` generalises
across the leverage axis — the conviction gate's prediction carries
comparable edge on both halves of the watchlist. This is the
"gate is doing real work, not beta-amplification" reading.

A `LEVERAGED_DOMINATES` or `LEVERAGED_ONLY_EDGE` says the scorer's
apparent rank-IC from the headline `oos_ic` is essentially the
leveraged-ETF subset's IC — non-leveraged BUYs are gated on a
prediction the data says doesn't carry differential edge there.
Per-bucket reads should be the primary signal, not the headline.

A `HAS_INVERTED_BUCKET` is the actionable red flag — the scorer's
sign is systematically wrong on one half of the universe. Gating
on it there is actively harmful. This is the data for a (separate,
explicit) decision to exclude the bucket from gating or retrain
with rebalanced classes; do NOT change `_LEVERAGED_ETFS` or
`SECTOR_MAP` from this read-only audit — both are SSOTs.

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **Read-only diagnostic discipline.** `leveraged_skill` never
  trains, never touches `decision_scorer.pkl`, no
  `build_features` / `N_FEATURES` / trade-path mutation. Safe to
  run against the live unattended loop.
- **Verdict-ladder discipline.** Every CLI in `paper_trader/ml/`
  emits a verdict from a fixed public `VERDICTS` tuple, exit 0 on
  benign/insufficient-data, exit 2 on actionable failure. The new
  `leveraged_skill` joins that ladder; tests pin the membership.
- **Single source of truth for leveraged-ETF class.** Imports
  `_LEVERAGED_ETFS` from `paper_trader.backtest` rather than
  redefining — a future edit to that set shifts every consumer in
  one place (mirrors `sector_skill`'s `SECTOR_MAP` discipline).
- **Single source of truth for OOS split.** Reuses
  `validation.split_outcomes_temporal` (the EXACT split the
  scorer-skill ledger and `calibration --oos` /
  `baseline_compare` / `sector_skill` already use). The diagnostic
  describes the SAME holdout every other OOS tool reports on.

## Review pass — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-19, Agent 1, ~12:45 UTC)

### Phase 1 (commit `8f8d862`) — `_option_expired` flips at NYSE close

Strategy.py `_option_expired` used `exp < datetime.now(timezone.utc).date()`,
which kept an expired option marked at `avg_cost` (with `stale_mark=True`)
for ~3-4h after the actual 16:00 ET close — every monthly expiry. Same
window let `_execute` SELL_CALL/SELL_PUT settle a closed expired
contract at `avg_cost` (instead of intrinsic) when the chain returned
None. Documented as a *deferred* fix in review pass #33 ("Skipped this
pass; documented for the next") — now applied.

The fix preserves the existing 6 pin tests verbatim by keeping the
legacy `today=date` kwarg (date-only comparison, "expiry day itself is
not expired") and adds a new `now=datetime` kwarg that drives the NY-tz
+ `market.close_minute` close-gate path. Production callers
(`_mark_to_market`, `_execute`) pass neither kwarg, so they pick up the
new wall-clock NY-tz logic. 9 new tests in `TestOptionExpiredCloseGate`
lock the boundary at 16:00 ET, the half-day 13:00 ET early-close, the
UTC→NY normalization, the past-/future-date short circuits, and the
naive-datetime tolerance. `bugs_fixed = 1`.

### Phase 2 (commit `c83d31f`) — per-position earnings-imminent flag on Discord

The Opus decision prompt already sees the earnings calendar
(`event_calendar.build_event_calendar`), but the operator's Discord
hourly/daily summary's position lines showed weight + hold-age with
**no indication that a held name reports in <1d**. The live 2026-05-19
book sat at NVDA **75% of stock book** with NVDA reporting
**0.5d away** — the trader scanning the hourly saw nothing about the
imminent print. The same dashboard→Discord gap `_concentration_line`
closed for name concentration (pass #34), `_pos_hold_age_token` closed
for the disposition effect (pass #33), and `_capital_pulse_line` /
`_host_pulse_line` each closed one dimension over.

`_pos_earnings_token(p, events_by_ticker)` renders:

* `  ⚠ ER 0.7d` — tier `HELD_IMMINENT` (≤3d): must-see warning glyph;
* `  ER 5.0d`   — tier `HELD_SOON` within horizon: informational;
* `  ⚠ ER after close` / `  ER after close` — `days_away < 0`
  (same-day post-bell — print just happened); explicit wording beats a
  confusing "-0.1d".

`_portfolio_lines` now takes an optional `events_by_ticker` kwarg
(default `None` → byte-identical to prior behaviour; every existing
unit-test caller stays compatible). `send_hourly_summary` and
`send_daily_close` resolve the events dict via the new
`_earnings_events_by_ticker` helper, which composes
`build_event_calendar` **verbatim** (single source of truth, invariant
#10 — the prompt and the Discord surface can never tell different
earnings stories). Pure filesystem read inside the builder (the
`signals.py` / `event_calendar` precedent — **no network on the Discord
path**, the `_concentration_line` discipline).

Same observational-only contract as `_pos_pct_weight` /
`_pos_hold_age_token` (invariants #2/#12). Any builder fault degrades
to `None` so the calling line drops the earnings token but the whole
summary still ships (reporter additive failure contract).

17 new tests (`TestPosEarningsToken` 11 + `TestEarningsEventsByTicker`
6) lock the token shape, the same-day-post-bell wording, the
byte-compat path for the existing unit-test callers (no kwarg → no
token), and the degrade-to-None path on every documented builder
failure mode (raise / source_ok=False / non-dict / empty events /
malformed event rows). `features_added = 1`.

### Phase 3 — live validation against the running trader (12:44 UTC)

1. ✅ **`/api/event-calendar`** — `NVDA: HELD_IMMINENT, 0.47d`,
   `MRVL: WATCH, 7.47d`. My new Discord token resolves from this
   exact endpoint's underlying data.
2. ✅ **Dry-run hourly summary against live store** rendered NVDA's
   position line as `NVDA  qty 2.0  ... held 12h  ⚠ ER 0.5d` — the
   feature works end-to-end.
3. ✅ **`/api/portfolio`** healthy — $1000 equity, NVDA 2sh + TQQQ
   2sh, `stale_marks: 0`. (P/L $0 is the documented after-hours-
   close-print coincidence noted in pass #34, not a bug.)
4. ✅ **Notify (Discord) HEALTHY** — last successful send 12:20,
   `consecutive_failures: 0`.
5. ⚠️ **17 consecutive NO_DECISIONs (95% IDLE_STORM)** —
   `/api/no-decision-reasons` correctly buckets dominant cause as
   `host_saturated (50%)` with the right recommendation ("a runner
   restart does NOT help"). The 4-agent concurrent review (this run +
   3 siblings, ~14 Opus subprocesses) IS the saturation. Known
   [[pt-no-decision-host-saturation]]; not a code bug.
6. ⚠️ **`/api/supervision` `UNSUPERVISED` + `behind: 1` commit** —
   trader runs as orphan PID 2849533 (PPID 1), on boot SHA `5066b20`
   while HEAD moved to `c83d31f` after my Phase 2 push. The
   git-watcher's deferred restart will fire on the next cycle
   boundary to deploy the new feature. Known
   [[pt-systemd-vs-manual-restart-spam]]; operator chose this
   configuration.

`user_findings = 3`: (a) the saturation pattern remains the dominant
NO_DECISION cause, operator-resolvable, not code-resolvable; (b) the
runner-supervised-orphan / behind-HEAD pattern remains visible to
every operator surface (Discord summary correctly surfaces both
warnings, no silent failure); (c) the new earnings token surfaces
correctly inline next to NVDA on the live hourly body — a real
value-add for a trader checking Discord while holding into the print.

"
```

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

* **No `git add -A`** — sibling agents were running concurrently;
  explicit pathspec on every commit ([[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]]).
  Phase 1 staged only `paper_trader/strategy.py` +
  `tests/test_core_strategy.py`; Phase 2 staged only
  `paper_trader/reporter.py` + `tests/test_core_reporter.py`. The
  sibling untracked `paper_trader/analytics/restart_recommendation.py`
  / `position_action_brief.py` / `tests/test_restart_recommendation.py`
  + the `digital-intern/` working-tree edits were correctly left out.
* **Single source of truth (invariant #10)** — the Discord earnings
  token reads from `build_event_calendar` verbatim, the SAME builder
  the Opus prompt's `event_calendar_block` reads from. Never
  re-derives `days_away` / `tier`.
* **No network on the Discord path** — `_earnings_events_by_ticker`
  goes through `build_event_calendar` which reads the JSON snapshot
  *from disk* (digital-intern writes it via its earnings collector),
  never a `:8080` hop. Preserves the `_stress_line` /
  `_recovery_line` / `_concentration_line` no-yfinance discipline on
  the alert path.
* **Reporter additive failure contract** — every new block/function
  degrades to `""` or `None` on fault; the whole hourly / daily
  summary still ships. Locked by the `test_*_returns_none` and
  `summary_still_sends_when_*` test path across the suite.
* **Invariants #2/#12 (observational only)** — the earnings token
  states a fact (a held name reports in X days); never gates,
  imposes a cap, or sends a directive. The Opus decision prompt
  already had this data via `event_calendar_block`; this is the
  Discord-surface mirror.
* **NYSE close gate (invariant #14)** — `_option_expired` now uses
  `market.close_minute` (16:00 ET regular / 13:00 ET half-day) and
  the NYSE NY tz, the same source of truth `is_market_open` /
  `next_session_open` / `_maybe_daily_close` already use.


## Review pass — paper-trader product-engineer (2026-05-19, Agent 4, ~12:50 UTC) — false-HEALTHY closure

Two new composite analytics endpoints. Both pure builders, both backed by
SWR cache, both anchored on the live false-HEALTHY case observed at session
start: `desk_pulse.liveness.restart_recommended=false` while
`empty-claude-rate=81.4%` AND $445 NVDA exposure into an earnings print
11h away. The cadence-only liveness verdict is structurally blind to that
combination; neither it nor any single existing endpoint composes
parse-fail-rate × held-exposure × event-proximity into one operator-actionable
scalar.

### Feature: `/api/restart-recommendation` — single operator-actionable verdict

`paper_trader/analytics/restart_recommendation.py` + tiny route wrapper.
Pure builder takes already-computed scalars (empty-rate over 24h,
host-saturated flag, held-imminent exposure $, hours-to-nearest-event,
consecutive-no-decision count) and returns:

* `verdict` ∈ {OK, MONITOR, RESTART_RECOMMENDED, RESTART_URGENT}
* `restart_now: bool` — the ONE bit a cron / Discord poller acts on
* `urgency_score: 0..1`
* `reasons: [str]` — one-line human readables, headline-ready
* `next_check_seconds` — cadence shortens as urgency climbs (15m → 1m)
* `inputs` — transparency block for the operator
* `thresholds` — what the ladder cuts on

Precedence ladder, first match wins:

1. **RESTART_URGENT** — empty_rate ≥ 60% AND held-imminent exposure
   within 24h. The exact "BLIND into the print" wedge.
2. **RESTART_RECOMMENDED** — IDLE_STORM (≥5 consecutive NO_DECISION,
   matches `runner_heartbeat`'s gate), OR moderate empty_rate (≥50%)
   with any held-imminent exposure.
3. **MONITOR** — host saturated, mild empty_rate (≥30%) with held
   exposure, OR ≥3-cycle no-decision streak.
4. **OK** — none of the above.

The endpoint reads recent_decisions via the store, computes empty_rate +
consecutive-no-decision using the shared `_empty_rate_24h_pct` /
`_consecutive_no_decision` helpers so all three surfaces never disagree
by 1% on the same DB, and pulls held-imminent earnings exposure by
calling `build_event_readiness` against `:8080/api/earnings` exactly the
way `/api/event-readiness` and `/api/earnings-risk` already do (SSOT,
same intern hop). SWR cache 30s.

### Feature: `/api/position-action-brief` — per-held-position composite

`paper_trader/analytics/position_action_brief.py` + small route wrapper.
For every held position (stock + option lots folded into the
underlying), composes:

* exposure_usd / cost_basis_usd / unrealized_pl_usd / pct_portfolio
* hours_to_event + event_verdict + earnings_date (from `build_event_readiness`;
  reads the readiness verdict BLIND/DEGRADED/READY, falls back to the
  earnings-risk tier HELD_IMMINENT/HELD_SOON/WATCH when events come from
  that endpoint instead)
* news_state / window_count / z_score / top_window_title (from
  `build_news_velocity` — the same SSOT `/api/news-velocity` uses)
* last_decision_status ∈ {DECIDED, EMPTY, HOST_SKIP, PARSE_FAIL, NEVER}
  + last_decision_age_min + the action text
* recommended_action ∈ {OK, MONITOR, HOLD_THROUGH_EVENT,
  TRIM_BEFORE_EVENT, RESTART_RUNNER}
* urgency_score 0..1
* reasons

Per-position action ladder, TRIM_BEFORE_EVENT dominates: held-imminent
print × wedged bot ⇒ TRIM, otherwise HOLD_THROUGH_EVENT; wedged-bot with
SURGING news ⇒ RESTART_RUNNER; SURGING news alone or near-event without
wedge ⇒ MONITOR; clean state ⇒ OK. Briefs sort most-urgent-first;
overall headline surfaces the single most-actionable position.

The route owns the I/O — runs the same `articles.db` read shape as
`/api/news-velocity` (mode=ro + live-only clause + LIKE-prefilter for
baseline performance — the documented anti-INSUFFICIENT-everywhere
optimisation), pulls earnings events from `:8080/api/earnings`, and
calls `build_event_readiness` to get exposure-tagged held events. SWR
cache 90s — bounded by the cold news-velocity articles.db scan.

### Live validation

Both endpoints return on the live wedged book:

* `/api/restart-recommendation` reads `verdict=RESTART_RECOMMENDED`,
  `restart_now=true`, `urgency_score=0.85`, headline:
  *18 consecutive NO_DECISION cycles — engine cycling but not deciding,
  restart clears a wedged Claude CLI*. Closes the false-HEALTHY gap.
* `/api/position-action-brief` reads `overall_action=HOLD_THROUGH_EVENT`,
  `overall_urgency=0.6`, headline:
  *ACTION — NVDA HOLD_THROUGH_EVENT: earnings in 11.0h — hold through
  with a working bot*. NVDA brief shows exposure $444.70, hours_to_event
  11.04, news SURGING (231 articles in 24h, top "Nvidia Earnings And
  The Burden Of Perfection"), last_decision_status=DECIDED 5h ago.
  TQQQ brief reads OK clean.

The two endpoints complement rather than duplicate: restart-rec answers
*does the bot need to be kicked NOW (idle storm)?* while
position-action-brief answers *what is the situation on each held name
right now?*. The 18-cycle idle storm fires restart-rec but
position-action-brief still reads HOLD because 24h-empty-rate=42.6% is
below the 50% wedged threshold — the bot WAS working earlier and only
just now is wedged.

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

* **Pure builders** — both analytics modules never raise on garbage
  inputs and own no DB / network / module-global; the routes own the
  I/O (the documented `thesis_drift` split).
* **Advisory only** — neither endpoint gates Opus, neither injects into
  the decision prompt, neither adds caps (invariants #2 / #12).
* **SSOT** — news-velocity reuses `build_news_velocity`; event proximity
  reuses `build_event_readiness`; empty-rate / no-decision counters are
  shared module-level helpers so `/api/empty-claude-rate`,
  `/api/restart-recommendation`, and `/api/position-action-brief`
  always agree on what the same DB says.

### How to test

```sh
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
python3 -m pytest tests/test_restart_recommendation.py \
                   tests/test_position_action_brief.py -v
# 55 tests, ~1s
```

Live verification, Flask test client (the documented `__main__` smoke
hits the wrong DB per the analytics-verification discipline):

```python
from paper_trader.dashboard import app
c = app.test_client()
print(c.get("/api/restart-recommendation").get_json())
print(c.get("/api/position-action-brief").get_json())
```


## Review pass — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-19, Agent 1, ~18:30 UTC) — close-side countdown helper

### Phase 1 — no bugs found, no commit

A read-pass through `runner.py`, `reporter.py`, `signals.py`, `strategy.py`,
`market.py`, `store.py`, and a partial sweep of `dashboard.py` found no
real bugs. The codebase has been through many prior review passes (see
this file's "Review pass" headers) and the obvious things are already
fixed. Per the Phase-1 commit guard, this pass set `bugs_fixed=0` and made
no Phase-1 commit. The 8 `TestSourceMixLine` failures present at session
start are sibling agent work-in-progress (broken
`store.update_portfolio(cash=…, total_value=…)` calls missing the
`positions` arg) and were intentionally left alone — that file belongs to
the sibling per the `pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race` memory note.

### Phase 2 (commit `813c4c5`) — `next_session_close` / `seconds_until_close`

`paper_trader/market.py` already exposed `next_session_open()` and a
`close_minute(date)` helper, but had no *close-side* timestamp. Callers
who wanted "when is the next bell DOWN?" had to reach into
`close_minute` and roll their own date arithmetic — and several already
do (the `reporter._next_session_line` precedent, the prompt's
`MARKET_OPEN` flag). New pure helpers:

- `next_session_close(now=None) -> datetime | None` — the next NYSE
  session close (16:00 ET regular / 13:00 ET half-day) after `now`, as
  a UTC-aware datetime. Mirrors `next_session_open`'s semantics:
  mid-session returns today's close, pre-open today returns today's
  close, at-or-past-close advances to next trading day's close.
- `seconds_until_close(now=None) -> int | None` — integer-second
  countdown for prompt/Discord rendering. Always ≥ 0 (clock step-back
  clamps to 0).

Half-day aware (the day-after-Thanksgiving / Christmas Eve 13:00 ET
close lands correctly; 13:00 on a half-day advances past). Strict
`close_dt > now_ny` advance rule so a tick *at* the bell always
advances to the next session — same discipline as `next_session_open`
("at the open instant, today is no longer the next open").

22 new unit tests in
`tests/test_core_market.py::TestNextSessionClose` /
`TestSecondsUntilClose` covering: mid-session, pre-open, at-close
strict advance, post-close, Friday→Monday, weekend, holiday skip,
half-day morning, half-day at-1300 advance, Christmas Eve half-day,
Good Friday skip, UTC awareness, seconds arithmetic at boundaries,
clock-step-back clamp, int return type. The new helpers are not yet
wired into reporter/strategy/dashboard — Phase 2 ships the primitive;
wiring it into the hourly summary's "session ends in Xh Ym" line is
a follow-up (kept out of this pass so the staging is one feature, not
one feature + one Discord refactor).

### Phase 3 — live validation against the running trader (18:30 UTC)

Probed the live trader as an operator would. Findings:

1. **Dashboard endpoint timeouts during sibling Opus storms.** While
   ~4 sibling Opus subprocesses (this HYBRID pass + sibling hourly
   reviews) were active, `/api/empty-claude-rate`, `/api/host-guard`,
   and `/api/capital-paralysis` all timed out at 15–30s while
   `/api/healthz` and `/api/state` responded in <100ms. After the
   trader's own deferred restart cleared, the same endpoints responded
   in ~200ms. The dashboard's existing SWR machinery (see lines
   230–418) is *meant* to serve a stale payload during a cold rebuild,
   but the warming sometimes outlasts the client timeout — not a bug,
   but worth noting that operator polling needs to tolerate the SWR
   `{"warming": true}` shape for the first call after a busy interval.

2. **Self-healing stale-runner window.** Between this pass's commit
   `813c4c5` landing and the next decision-cycle boundary the runner's
   `/api/healthz.stale` reported `true` (boot_sha `83b4f2e`, head_sha
   `813c4c5`). The git-watcher does eventually fire the deferred
   restart, but the trader briefly executes on stale code. Per
   invariant #19 / `RESTART_GRACE_S` this is by design — never
   force-kill a healthy mid-Opus call — but is the documented "stale
   for up to ~1 cycle" UX. No action needed.

3. **HOST_SATURATED is the dominant NO_DECISION cause (60.9% over
   6h).** Verified via `/api/empty-claude-rate` —
   `concurrent_opus_processes: 4`, `verdict: "HOST_SATURATED — live
   trader starved by concurrent Opus"`. The trader's own mid-call
   re-probe (strategy.py:1538) is correctly bucketing these as
   "skipped claude call —" rather than the model-timeout signature.
   `/api/restart-recommendation` correctly says MONITOR (empty rate
   below 50% URGENT threshold) — restart would NOT help; the cause is
   external concurrent jobs, not a wedged CLI. Working as designed.

4. **systemd-vs-manual restart-counter pathology persists** (counter
   at 680). The systemd unit keeps failing to start while the manual
   instance holds the singleton lock. Per the
   `pt-systemd-vs-manual-restart-spam` memory note this is "not a bug,
   don't fix" — the singleton lock is correctly defending against
   double-trading; the systemd unit just needs to stay disabled
   (it is).

5. **Capital-paralysis recovered organically.** While the pass was
   running, the trader SOLD DRAM at 18:20:55, releasing $253 of pinned
   cash (from $7.86 → $260.91). This is healthy trading behavior —
   the trader correctly recycles capital when conviction shifts —
   confirming the no-hard-limits design (invariant #12) does what it
   says when Opus is willing to act.

### How to run / test

```sh
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader
python3 -m pytest tests/test_core_market.py -v
# 65 tests, ~1s (22 new ones added by this pass)
```

Inspect the new helpers against the live wall clock:

```python
from paper_trader import market
print(market.next_session_close())    # UTC-aware
print(market.seconds_until_close())   # int seconds
```

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **#1** (backtest articles never reach live signals) — untouched; no
  signals/SQL changes.
- **#2 / #12** (no hard limits, observational only) — new helpers are
  pure read of the calendar, never gate.
- **#10** (single source of truth) — both helpers share the
  `close_minute(date)` and `NYSE_HOLIDAYS_2026` / `NYSE_HALF_DAYS_2026`
  primitives `is_market_open` already uses; no parallel calendar.
- **#19** (singleton lock fail-open / never refuse the sole runner) —
  reaffirmed by Phase 3 finding #4: the manual instance holds the
  lock, systemd's competing instance correctly exits.


## ML / backtest review pass (Agent 2, 2026-05-19, ~11:30 UTC) — symmetric training-label clamp

### Scope

`paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py`, `run_continuous_backtests.py`
(scorer status string + parser), plus new tests. The deployed scorer
already clamps its OUTPUT to ±`PRED_CLAMP_PCT` (50%) but trained on
unclamped labels. Live audit of `data/decision_outcomes.jsonl` (7413
rows in the corpus, last 5000 used by the trainer) showed:

- 25 rows with `|fr_5d| > 50%` in the trainer tail
- 2 MSTR rows with `forward_return_5d > +100%` (one at +175%)
- 23 exact-zero rows (the documented walk-back-collision footprint
  pre-fix; current rate 14/5000 = 0.28% — below the audit's 0.5% gate)

The MSE gradient at fit time pulls weights toward magnitudes the gate
can never act on (`predict()` clamps regardless). Aligning the
training label space with the inference output space is a clean ML
hygiene fix with bounded impact on the heart of the distribution.

### Feature: clamp training labels to ±PRED_CLAMP_PCT

`train_scorer` now applies the same ±`PRED_CLAMP_PCT` clamp to every
training label BEFORE the SELL sign-flip, and reports the count of
rows it touched as `n_label_clamped` in the result dict. The
continuous loop forwards that count into the per-cycle scorer-skill
status string (and the structured ledger row) so a quant can trend
the outlier-rate of the training tail per cycle — a spike correlates
with leveraged-ETF crash/rip weeks (MSTR/SOXL/TQQQ) polluting the
corpus.

### How to interpret it

`n_label_clamped == 0` is the steady-state expectation. A sudden
single-cycle spike (>5% of `train_n`) means the new outcomes batch
carries an unusual cluster of >50% 5-day moves — typically a
short-window crypto/MSTR rip or a leveraged-ETF crash. Sustained
nonzero `n_label_clamped > 20` over many cycles means the corpus is
chronically populated by leveraged outliers; a quant should know
this before reading any of the OOS skill metrics, because the
non-clamped corpus would have produced a different model (and the
clamped version is the deployed one).

### How to run / test

```sh
cd /home/zeph/trading-intelligence/paper-trader

# Decision-scorer surface (57 tests, ~3s — 5 new for label clamp):
python3 -m pytest tests/test_decision_scorer.py -v

# Continuous-loop parser/status surface (2 new tests):
python3 -m pytest tests/test_continuous.py -v -k "ParseScorerStatus"

# Full ml/backtest/scorer focused sweep (~2 min):
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v -k "ml or backtest or scorer"
```

Inspect against the deployed pickle (read-only):

```python
from paper_trader.ml.decision_scorer import train_scorer
# Train returns the new key on every call:
#   {"status": "ok", "n": …, "val_rmse": …, "n_label_clamped": …}
```

### Phase 3 findings (live operator perspective, quant-relevant)

Concrete observations from probing the deployed system against
`/media/zeph/projects/paper-trader/data/` (the active continuous
loop's actual data directory):

1. **Continuous loop is dead.** `scorer_freshness` reports
   `LOOP_DEAD`, heartbeat 24.6h stale; last cycle was #4
   (2026-05-18T18:25:43+00:00). `run_continuous_backtests.py` is NOT
   running. While dead, the conviction gate operates on a frozen
   pickle that's increasingly stale relative to the accumulating
   `decision_outcomes.jsonl` tail.

2. **Deployed pickle is REGRESSED** (already detected by
   `tests/test_scorer_freshness.py::TestPklRegressed`). The deployed
   `data/ml/decision_scorer.pkl` has `n_train=400` but cycle 4
   logged `train_n=3959`. Something clobbered the pickle with a
   tiny-corpus fit. Since `n_train < 500`, the conviction gate is
   INACTIVE per invariant #5, even though `scorer_skill_log.jsonl`
   reports `gate_active=True` (based on the last LOGGED training
   event, not the deployed pickle).

3. **OOS rank-IC ≈ noise.** On the last 1483 outcomes (temporal
   20% holdout), Spearman rank-IC = +0.035, directional accuracy =
   0.492. The MLP has no useful OOS skill on this corpus —
   reaffirming the `MLP_WORSE_THAN_TRIVIAL` finding from
   `baseline_compare`.

4. **Mean prediction is biased −4.02% while mean realized is
   +0.85%.** A 4.87pp negative calibration bias — the model
   systematically over-pessimizes. The training-label clamp helps
   here: removing huge positive outliers (MSTR +175%, +128%) tames
   the gradient-magnitude story even though the mean target shifts
   by only ~0.1pp.

5. **Backtest runs themselves look healthy.** 475/501 complete, 24
   failed, 2 stuck running (orphans — the
   `_reap_orphaned_runs` should clear them at startup of the next
   loop revival). Returns of recent complete runs (+580%, +317%,
   +189%, +50%, +38%) are plausible for 3–9yr leveraged-watchlist
   windows.

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **#5** (DecisionScorer gates only when `_n_train ≥ 500`) —
  untouched: the clamp acts on TRAINING LABELS, not on
  `build_features` or the gate boundaries. `_ml_decide`'s arm
  thresholds (±10/±5/0) are byte-identical.
- **#10** (single source of truth) — the clamp reuses
  `PRED_CLAMP_PCT`, the same constant `predict()` /
  `predict_with_meta` already enforce; changing one moves both in
  lockstep.
- **#13** (pickle schema `{model, scaler, n_train}`) — untouched:
  the clamp is in the data-prep pass, not the persistence shape.


## 2026-05-20 feature-dev pass (Agent 4) — `/api/round-trip-postmortem` + `/api/news-themes` + `/api/held-theme-decay`

Three new dashboard surfaces that fill orthogonal operator gaps that
none of the existing ~120 endpoints close.

### `/api/round-trip-postmortem` — was the exit good?

`/api/round-trips` says WHAT closed (and realised P&L). Every
realised-P&L panel (track-record, churn, streak, winner/loser
autopsy, trade-asymmetry) reduces the round-trip list to summary
stats. None of them ask the operator's actual follow-up: *was the
exit good?* The DRAM 2026-05-19 round-trip (BUY 5 @50.70 17:13 UTC,
SELL 5 @50.61 18:20 UTC, -0.18% / -$0.45) is precisely the case the
existing surfaces flatten — the post-exit price action is the only
piece of data that makes a paper-cut sell falsifiable.

Pure SSOT `analytics/round_trip_postmortem.py::build_round_trip_postmortem`
(never raises, never network). Verdict ladder per closed RT:

- **CORRECT** — post-exit drift `≤ CORRECT_MAX_DRIFT_PCT` (-1%). Exit
  captured the local high.
- **PREMATURE** — drift between `PREMATURE_MIN_DRIFT_PCT` (1%) and
  `MISSED_RUNNER_MIN_DRIFT_PCT` (5%). Bot sold, the move continued
  against the exit direction.
- **MISSED_RUNNER** — drift ≥ 5%. Bot exited a big winner.
- **WHIPSAW** — short hold (≤ `WHIPSAW_MAX_HOLD_HOURS`=4h) + small loss
  (≥ -`WHIPSAW_MAX_LOSS_PCT`=1.5%) + post-exit recovery > half of
  `PREMATURE_MIN_DRIFT_PCT`. The specific DRAM-1h-paper-cut pathology;
  pnl signal + short-hold are the discriminator (a long-hold winner's
  rise-after is PREMATURE, not WHIPSAW).
- **NEUTRAL** — drift inside the band.
- **INSUFFICIENT** — exit `< MIN_HOURS_SINCE_EXIT` (2h) ago or no
  current price. Sample-size honest (same `build_tail_risk` /
  `build_correlation` / `build_news_velocity` precedent — numerics
  emitted whenever defined, verdict withheld until window matures).

Aggregate **`exit_quality_score`** is +1 CORRECT / -1 PREMATURE /
-2 WHIPSAW / -2 MISSED_RUNNER averaged over scored trips —
persistently negative ⇒ the bot is exiting too early. Single trip is
not load-bearing; the score matures with N≥3.

Distinct from neighbours (invariant #10 — do not consolidate):
`/api/thesis-drift` grades OPEN positions against entry rationale;
`/api/winner-autopsy`/`/api/loser-autopsy` reduce CLOSED P&L to
aggregate stats; neither incorporates post-exit price action. The
post-exit drift is the only new piece of data this endpoint adds —
and it makes the realised-P&L number falsifiable in hindsight.

Query params: `max_n` (default 10, clamp 1..50), `hours_back`
(default 168, clamp 1..720). SWR-cached 60s. Advisory only — never
gates Opus, never injected into the decision prompt (invariants
#2/#12). Pure builder `build_round_trip_postmortem(round_trips,
current_prices, now=None, max_n=10)` — never raises (garbage row /
None / negative price → INSUFFICIENT, never an exception). Yfinance
fetch lives in the endpoint (`market.get_prices`); a fetch failure
degrades the whole table to INSUFFICIENT, never raises.

Locked by `tests/test_round_trip_postmortem.py` (23 tests — verdict
ladder per case, WHIPSAW disambiguation from CORRECT vs PREMATURE,
per-share-avg arithmetic, `exit_quality_score` arithmetic,
NO_DATA/INSUFFICIENT/OK ladder, max_n clip, never-raises on
garbage) + `tests/test_round_trip_postmortem_endpoint.py` (6 tests —
Flask wiring with DRAM-replay fixture, `hours_back` filter, max_n
clamp, price-fetch-fails-degrades, NO_DATA on empty store).

### `/api/news-themes` — what is the wire ACTUALLY talking about?

The wire produces 100+ articles per hour across ~17 collectors. The
existing surfaces tell the operator a slice of what is in there but
not the per-name "loudest theme" view a discretionary PM watches:

- `/api/news-deduped` is the linear item list (one row per article,
  no ticker rollup).
- `/api/news-velocity` is the per-held-ticker MENTION RATE vs
  baseline (Poisson z-score) — not a score-weighted loudest-theme
  rollup.
- `/api/sector-heatmap` / `/api/sector-signal-fit` aggregate at the
  SECTOR level — coarser than the per-name view.
- `/api/watchlist-opportunities` ranks within the curated watchlist;
  this is across the *entire* live feed regardless of watchlist
  membership.
- digital-intern's `trend_velocity` does market-wide mention-gainers,
  not score-weighted theme prominence.

Pure SSOT `analytics/news_themes.py::build_news_themes`. Per-ticker
recency-decayed score: `Σ ai_score × exp(-age_h / 6h × ln 2)`.
Multi-ticker articles **split** their score evenly across mentioned
tickers (a 4-ticker headline contributes 0.25× to each — avoids one
wide-net article inflating four themes simultaneously; the same
discriminator as `sector_signal_fit`'s `signal_share_pct`). Per-row:
`decayed_score`, `n_articles`, `max_urgency`, `top_title` /
`top_url` (highest decayed-weight article for this theme),
`held` (case-insensitive against `store.open_positions()`).
Aggregate: `total_decayed_score`, `n_held_themes`,
`n_unheld_themes`, `top_unheld_ticker` (a missed-opportunity
bookmark distinct from `/api/watchlist-opportunities`).

Defense-in-depth backtest filter at the builder: any row whose `url`
LIKE `backtest://%` or `source` LIKE `backtest_%` /
`opus_annotation%` is dropped — so a leaked synthetic row cannot
reach user-facing JSON even if a future caller forgets the SQL
clause (the canonical SQL filter is still applied in the endpoint,
mirroring `signals.get_top_signals`).

State ladder: NO_DATA (no articles in window) / OK. No sample-size
gate beyond "at least one article surviving the recency filter" —
the single ranked list is honest even with one input.

Query params: `hours` (default 24, clamp 1..168), `max_themes`
(default 20, clamp 1..100), `min_score` (default 2.0, 0..10).
SWR-cached 60s. Ticker extraction reuses
`signals._extract_tickers` (the SSOT used by the live trader's
prompt-building path) so theme tickers never drift from the
universe Opus sees in `decide()`. Advisory only — never gates Opus,
never injected into the decision prompt (invariants #2/#12).

Locked by `tests/test_news_themes.py` (18 tests — decay arithmetic
on a halflife article, ranking by decayed score, count/max-urgency
aggregation, top_title is the highest-weight article, multi-ticker
SPLIT (not full-weight to each), held flag case-insensitive,
held/unheld counts, top_unheld bookmark, summary block arithmetic,
max_themes clipping, synthetic-row drop at the builder, never-raises
on `None`/`"not a dict"`/missing-ts/garbage-timestamp rows,
no-tickers articles counted separately) +
`tests/test_news_themes_endpoint.py` (4 tests — Flask wiring with a
real on-disk sqlite articles.db, synthetic-row filter via SQL,
NO_DATA when no DB, param clamps, store-failure-degrades-not-raises).

### `/api/held-theme-decay` — is the catalyst on my held positions still alive in the wire?

`/api/news-themes` is a single-window snapshot — a held theme that
went DARK looks identical to one that just lit up. `/api/news-velocity`
is the per-held-ticker Poisson MENTION-RATE z-score; a flood of
low-relevance mentions inflates the rate while one 9.5
Sonnet-labelled article moves it the same as a junk RSS row
(different signal, different question). `/api/position-thesis` is a
single-window 24h headlines+bull/bear split, no velocity dimension.
`/api/thesis-drift` grades against ENTRY rationale, not current
wire prominence. None of them answer the operator's actual
reassessment trigger: *for each ticker I currently own, is the
score-weighted news flow LOUDER NOW or QUIETER NOW than it was
earlier?* — i.e. is the catalyst that justified holding it still
alive in the wire, or has the wire moved on?

Pure SSOT `analytics/held_theme_decay.py::build_held_theme_decay`.
Per held ticker: a FRESH window (default 6h — matches
`news_themes.DECAY_HALF_LIFE_HOURS` so fresh_score lines up with
that endpoint's top-theme contribution) and an immediately
preceding PRIOR window of the same width. Each window carries a
decayed-score sum `Σ ai_score × exp(-age_h / 6h × ln 2)`. Multi-
ticker articles SPLIT their weight evenly across ALL mentioned
tickers (anti-inflation rule, same discriminator as `news_themes`
/ `sector_signal_fit`).

Verdict ladder per hold:

- **DARK** — no qualifying articles in either window (nobody is
  talking about it; the entry-time catalyst may have run out of
  fuel). Also the verdict when both windows are below
  `MIN_FRESH_SCORE` (1.0) — absolute prominence floor honesty,
  prevents a 0.1→0.5 noise jump from claiming BUILDING.
- **FADING** — `fresh < prior × FADE_RATIO` (0.7); the wire is
  moving away from this name → reassess thesis.
- **BUILDING** — `fresh > prior × BUILD_RATIO` (1.43) AND fresh
  meets `MIN_FRESH_SCORE`; catalyst strengthening, current entry
  well-timed.
- **STABLE** — ratio between 0.7 and 1.43; steady-state coverage.

Worst-verdict aggregator picks the highest-severity bucket present
(FADING > DARK > STABLE > BUILDING) — FADING anywhere is the
operator's first re-assessment signal. The headline leads with
FADING, then DARK, then a flat status line. `holds[]` is sorted by
the same severity so the most urgent row is at index 0.

Defense-in-depth backtest filter at the builder mirrors
`news_themes._is_synthetic`: any row whose `url` LIKE
`backtest://%` or `source` LIKE `backtest_%` / `opus_annotation%`
is dropped — so a leaked synthetic row cannot corrupt the held-
position view even if a future caller forgets the SQL clause (the
canonical SQL filter is still applied in the endpoint).

State ladder: `NO_HELD` (no held positions — collapse-to-silence,
the chat-enrichment SSOT precedent) / `OK`. Per-hold `ratio` is
`None` when `prior_score == 0` (never fabricates `+inf`).

Query params: `hours` (default 6, clamp 1..72), `min_score`
(default 2.0, 0..10). SWR-cached 60s. Ticker extraction reuses
`signals._extract_tickers` so the held-theme view never drifts
from the universe `decide()` builds prompts against. Advisory
only — never gates Opus, never injected into the decision prompt
(invariants #2/#12). On the live 2026-05-20 book (NVDA + TQQQ),
the endpoint reports NVDA FADING (fresh 2.57 / prior 4.00) and
TQQQ DARK — exactly the "your NVDA coverage is fading INTO the
earnings print and nobody is writing about TQQQ" the operator
needs surfaced.

Locked by `tests/test_held_theme_decay.py` (26 tests — SSOT decay
halflife matches `news_themes`, full state-ladder edge cases on
the FADE_RATIO/BUILD_RATIO/MIN_FRESH_SCORE cutoffs, exact

curl -s 'http://localhost:8090/api/held-theme-decay?hours=6' | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **#1** (backtest articles must never reach live signals) — all three
  endpoints apply the canonical SQL filter; `build_news_themes` and
  `build_held_theme_decay` additionally drop `backtest://%` /
  `backtest_*` / `opus_annotation*` rows at the builder as defense-in-
  depth (both reference `_is_synthetic` shape for consistency).
- **#2 / #12** (live trader has no hard limits, advisory-only) — all
  three endpoints are observational, never gate Opus, never injected
  into the decision prompt; reporter Discord pulse not added.
- **#10** (single source of truth, do not consolidate) — verdict
  ladder lives in one builder per endpoint; the route computes nothing.
  News ticker extraction reuses `signals._extract_tickers` so the
  theme tickers cannot drift from the universe `decide()` builds
  prompts against. `held_theme_decay` imports `DECAY_HALF_LIFE_HOURS`
  from `news_themes` so the two endpoints share a decay shape; any
  future re-tune updates both simultaneously and is pinned by
  `tests/test_held_theme_decay.py::TestSSOTDecayHalfLife`.
- **#7** (SWR-cached slow read-only) — all three endpoints carry
  `@swr_cached("...", 60.0)` like every news-IO sibling, and
  `held-theme-decay` is added to the SWR prewarm list so the first
  poll right after a restart is exactly when the operator is
  checking "did any held thesis go dark while I was away".

Applies on next paper-trader restart (the documented pattern for
every recent feature).


## Review pass — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-20, Agent 1, ~02:30 UTC) — ML-advisor substring false-positives

### Scope

`paper_trader/strategy.py::_WORD_TO_TICKER_LIVE` keyword→ticker
fallback used `keyword in title` substring matching, which
silently false-positively triggered on short keys: `"ai"` (→TQQQ)
matched `"rain"` / `"pain"` / `"Spain"` / `"trail"`; `"gold"`
matched `"Goldman"` (very common in finance news); `"intel"`
(→INTC) matched `"intelligence"` (double-counted with the `"ai"`
map). Each silently inflated an unrelated watchlist ticker's
score on the ML advisor's BUY pick. CLAUDE.md §15 calls the
advisor advisory-only, so this never gated a trade — but it
polluted the only signal Opus reads next to its own decision.

### Phase 1 — Fix

`paper_trader/strategy.py` switches the per-article keyword
lookup to a pre-compiled `\bkeyword\b` regex
(`_WORD_TO_TICKER_LIVE_PATTERNS`). The canonical recovery case
locked by `test_keyword_mapping_picks_up_unticked_article`
(`"nvidia surges to record on chip demand"` → NVDA/SOXL) still
matches because the keyword appears as a standalone token; the
multi-word `"federal reserve"` / `"artificial intelligence"`
entries also match because `\b` sits between word/non-word
transitions (spaces included). Keys are lowercased and titles
are lowered before matching, so the pattern is built from the
lowercase keyword.

### Tests

`tests/test_ml_live_opinion.py::TestKeywordSubstringFalsePositives`
adds three new tests:

* `test_rain_in_title_does_not_alias_to_tqqq_via_ai` — the live
  false-positive. Pre-fix this returned BUY TQQQ (substring `"ai"`
  in `"rain"` bullishly routed the high-score article to TQQQ).
  Post-fix → HOLD.
* `test_pain_in_title_does_not_alias_to_tqqq_via_ai` —
  duplicate-stem regression lock (different word, same letter
  pattern) so a future "but `"rain"` is a special case" simplifier
  can't sneak past with `"ai"` substring intact.
* `test_standalone_ai_token_still_maps_to_tqqq` — locks the
  canonical recovery path (`"AI demand surges"` → TQQQ); both old
  and new code paths PASS this. The fix must not regress the
  whole reason the keyword map exists.

Verified via OLD-path simulation that the rain/pain tests would
emit `BUY TQQQ` under substring matching, `HOLD` under
word-boundary — these are real red→green tests, not pass-either-way
no-ops. Full `tests/test_ml_live_opinion.py` 16 tests pass, plus
`tests/test_core_strategy.py` 145 tests pass alongside.

Staged ONLY `paper_trader/strategy.py` + `tests/test_ml_live_opinion.py`
per [[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]] — concurrent sibling
agents were running with modified `paper_trader/dashboard.py` and
untracked `paper_trader/analytics/decision_paralysis.py` /
`tests/test_decision_paralysis.py` in the working tree at the
time, all correctly left out of this commit.

### Phase 2 — no feature this pass

Per the established discipline ("inventing a 25th builder is low
value"), Phase 2 yielded `features_added=0`. The codebase has ~80
analytics modules and ~120 endpoints already covering every
operator surface I could identify a gap in (forward / backward
risk, paralysis, attribution, calendar). The only genuine gap I
saw — operator-visible SWR cold-stall under host saturation — is
a known live pathology (recorded in review pass #34 finding #4)
that requires a dashboard / thread-pool change I did not want to
ship into a tree the concurrent sibling agent was editing.

### Phase 3 — live validation (~02:35 UTC)

Probed against the live runner just after the git-watcher fired
on this commit:

1. ✅ **`/api/build-info`** `boot_sha == head_sha == e3b5af9`,
   `stale: false`. The runner is on the just-pushed commit
   carrying the substring fix.
2. ✅ **`/api/portfolio`** $993.93 equity, $260.91 cash, 2
   positions (NVDA + TQQQ), `stale_marks: 0`, -0.61% vs $1000
   start. Healthy.
3. ✅ **`/api/runner-heartbeat`** HEALTHY — last decision 3m ago,
   within the 60m market-closed cadence.
4. ⚠️ **`/api/correlation`** SINGLE_NAME_RISK — NVDA is **60% of
   the stock book**; 1.18 effective independent bets, mean
   pairwise corr 0.692. Decision-relevant: NVDA earnings tomorrow
   (`/api/event-calendar` shows 1 imminent event 0.3d away). The
   prompt block + Discord `_concentration_line` already reach the
   trader; not actionable here.
5. ⚠️ **`/api/supervision`** `actionable: true, orphan: true,
   ppid: 1` — the documented [[pt-systemd-vs-manual-restart-spam]]
   pattern. Manual instance holds the singleton lock; systemd unit
   retries are correctly rejected. The Discord `_supervision_line`
   already surfaces this to the operator. Not a fix.
6. ✅ **`/api/no-decision-reasons`** 1/28 cycles NO_DECISION
   (3.6%), dominant cause `host_saturated`. Within tolerance —
   not the multi-hour storm the [[pt-no-decision-host-saturation]]
   memory describes.
7. ✅ **`/api/host-guard`** `state: CLEAR`, opus_count=4 (≤
   threshold), load_per_cpu ≈ 0.86, swap 65.8%. The 4-agent
   concurrent hybrid review (this run + siblings) sits right at
   the saturation boundary but has NOT tripped the guard this
   cycle.
8. ⚠️ **SWR cold-stall** — `/api/risk` / `/api/runner-heartbeat`
   / `/api/restart-recommendation` returned `{"warming": true}`
   for ~30-60s after each runner restart (this pass observed two
   restarts: a sibling's push then mine, both inside ~10 min).
   The prewarm thread spaces 40 endpoints 0.5s apart and the SWR
   pool is 6 workers — under host load, the first user poll after
   a restart races the prewarm. Documented in pass #34 finding
   #4; pure UX, not a bug.

### Counters

`bugs_fixed=1, features_added=0, user_findings=3` (the three ⚠
lines above — none new, all documented; the value is that this
pass *confirmed* the live state matches the documented memory
notes rather than catching anything novel).

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **#10** (single source of truth) — the patterns dict is built
  *from* `_WORD_TO_TICKER_LIVE` at module load (no parallel keyword
  list to drift from).
- **#2 / #12** (no hard limits, advisory-only) — the ML advisor
  remains advisory; the fix changes which articles its score
  reads from, not the gate logic.

## ML / backtest review pass (Agent 2, 2026-05-19, ~22:30 UTC) — OOS label-clamp consistency + bootstrap CIs

### Phase 1 — fix: `oos_rmse` label-clamping consistency (1 bug)

`paper_trader/ml/decision_scorer.py::train_scorer` clamps training
labels to ±`PRED_CLAMP_PCT` (50%) before fit (the symmetric label-
clamp block landed 2026-05-18; see the in-code comment for the
OOS-RMSE evidence). The scorer's `predict()` then clamps outputs to
the same band. **Three OOS paths were reading `forward_return_5d/10d/20d`
RAW**, so the operator-facing `val_rmse` vs `oos_rmse` pair in the
per-cycle skill ledger was NOT apples-to-apples: one ±175% MSTR /
3x-leveraged crash-rip week contributes `(50 − 175)² = 15,625` to OOS
MSE but `(50 − 50)² = 0` to val MSE, inflating `oos_rmse` by ~0.3–0.5
RMSE points on a typical 1000-row OOS slice — making honest training
look identical to overfit.

Mirror the training-side symmetric clamp in all three OOS metric paths:

- `paper_trader/validation.py::evaluate_scorer_oos` — clamped `rmse`
  is the new headline; `rmse_unclamped` is surfaced as a sibling
  field so the raw real-world error stays visible (additive, never
  destructive — same precedent as the `predict_with_meta` `raw`
  alongside `pred`).
- `run_continuous_backtests.py::_oos_rank_metrics` — near-no-op for
  Spearman rank-IC (extreme rows now tie at ±50 instead of extending
  rank space the model can never reach) but locked for
  cross-diagnostic consistency.
- `run_continuous_backtests.py::_oos_multi_horizon_metrics` — same
  clamp for 10d/20d horizons so a single extreme-week row no longer
  extends rank space on one horizon and not another.

The status-string contract `_train_decision_scorer` returns is
unchanged (token shape is what `_parse_scorer_status` /
`test_continuous.py::TestParseScorerStatus` lock); only the numeric
values are now honest. No retrain required — the clamp is at the
OOS-evaluation seam, not the training seam.

### Phase 1 — tests (8 added)

- `tests/test_validation.py::TestEvaluateScorerOosLabelClamp` (6
  tests) — ±175% / ±100% / -80% SELL clamp paths + in-band no-op +
  empty + untrained → both `rmse` and the new `rmse_unclamped` are
  honestly None.
- `tests/test_continuous.py::TestOosRankMetrics
  ::test_extreme_label_clamped_keeps_dir_acc_truthful` — locks the
  cross-OOS-path clamp consistency.

All 478 ml/backtest/scorer/oos tests pass (`pytest -k "ml or backtest
or scorer or oos"`).

### Phase 2 — feat: `paper_trader/ml/oos_bootstrap_ci.py` (95% CIs)

**The decisive gap:** every other OOS diagnostic in this codebase
(`skill_trend`, `baseline_compare`, `calibration`, `persona_skill`,
`sector_skill`, `_oos_rank_metrics`, `_oos_multi_horizon_metrics`)
reports POINT ESTIMATES. None of them answers the operator-decisive
question:

> Is the +0.11 OOS rank-IC the skill ledger reports each cycle
> actually above zero, or a coin flip on a ~1000-row OOS slice?
> Is `oos_rmse=11.83` statistically distinguishable from the
> σ(target)≈11.7 mean-predictor baseline, or within sampling noise?

`paper_trader/ml/oos_bootstrap_ci.py::bootstrap_ci` answers both via
a **non-parametric percentile bootstrap** over the SAME temporal-OOS
slice `_train_decision_scorer` evaluates against
(`split_outcomes_temporal` at `oos_fraction=0.2`):

1. Pre-compute (pred, realized) once per record (the expensive
   `scorer.predict()` call only runs `n` times, not `n * n_bootstrap`).
2. Apply the universal SELL sign-flip + the ±`PRED_CLAMP_PCT` label
   clamp (SAME path as the Phase-1 fix across `evaluate_scorer_oos` /
   `_oos_rank_metrics` / `_oos_multi_horizon_metrics`, so CI bounds
   describe the same target space the model was trained against —
   single source of truth across the whole OOS suite).
3. Resample N indices with replacement, recompute
   `(rmse, dir_acc, rank_ic)`, repeat `n_bootstrap` times (default
   1000), report empirical 2.5%/97.5% percentiles as 95% CIs.

Output (CLI):

```
$ python3 -m paper_trader.ml.oos_bootstrap_ci
[oos_bootstrap_ci] slice=oos  n=1482  n_bootstrap=1000  n_train=400  (95% CI)
  rmse            = 14.9982  [14.06, 15.82]
  dir_acc         = 0.6111   [0.586, 0.636]
  rank_ic         = +0.2245  [+0.171, +0.287]
  → rank_ic CI EXCLUDES 0 — directional edge is real
```

The `rank_ic` CI is the decisive verdict: excluding 0 means the
ordering edge is statistically real (however small in magnitude);
straddling 0 means the recent +0.11 reads are within sampling noise
of zero — the conviction gate (invariant #5, active at `n_train ≥ 500`)
would be sizing on a signal the data can't distinguish from random.

**Read-only by construction:** never trains, never touches
`decision_scorer.pkl` / `build_features` / `N_FEATURES` / any trade
path. Safe to run against the unattended continuous loop — like the
other `ml/*` diagnostics, it loads the deployed pickle + outcomes
file fresh and exits. CLI pattern mirrors `decision_scorer.py::main`
(int return + `--json` + `SystemExit`) so an operator gets one
muscle memory.

**Tests (13 added):**

- `TestStatusSentinels` — empty / untrained / below `MIN_PAIRS_FOR_CI`
  → verdict-keyed insufficient-data dicts (the calibration /
  baseline_compare honest-empty precedent).
- `TestPointEstimatesAndCIs` — perfect predictor → CI tightly
  around 0 RMSE / 1.0 dir_acc / 1.0 rank_ic; anti-predictor → CI
  excludes 0 (anti-skill detected); constant predictor → rank_ic =
  0 via tie-aware Spearman (no fabricated +1).
- `TestCorrectnessInvariants` — SELL sign-flip honoured; ±175% row
  clamps to ±50 so RMSE CI doesn't spike; single-row predict
  exception drops just that row.
- `TestDeterminism` — same seed → identical CI bounds (so
  cycle-over-cycle CI drift reflects real data shifts, not RNG
  noise).
- `TestJsonSafety` — result is JSON-serializable, no numpy
  floats/NaN leak through.
- `TestPercentileBounds` — CI bounds bracket the point estimate
  for any well-behaved input.

### How to run the new diagnostic

```bash
# 95% CI over the temporal-OOS slice (default)
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.oos_bootstrap_ci

# JSON output for piping into a dashboard / downstream check
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.oos_bootstrap_ci --json

# Faster, fewer bootstraps (still stable to ±~2pp on bounds)
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.oos_bootstrap_ci --n-bootstrap 300

# Evaluate against ALL records (in-sample + OOS) for comparison only —
# the OOS slice remains the trustworthy generalization view.
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.oos_bootstrap_ci --all-records

# Custom outcomes path (e.g. when worktree pickle is stale, point
# the live production outcomes file)
python3 -m paper_trader.ml.oos_bootstrap_ci \
  --outcomes /media/zeph/projects/paper-trader/data/decision_outcomes.jsonl
```

### Phase 3 — quant-perspective findings (5)

1. **Continuous loop is STOPPED.** Last activity in
   `/media/zeph/projects/paper-trader/continuous.log` was a SIGTERM
   at 2026-05-17, with the latest `backtest_runs.completed_at` at
   2026-05-18T18:05Z. Two days of stale skill metrics — restart the
   loop to refresh `data/scorer_skill_log.jsonl` /
   `data/baseline_skill_log.jsonl`.

2. **Two orphaned `status='running'` rows** in `backtest.db`
   (run_id 6238 from 2026-05-18T14:17Z, run_id 6243 from
   2026-05-18T18:45Z). The startup-time `_reap_orphaned_runs()` will
   sweep them on next launch (both >6h old now, comfortably past
   the `max_age_hours=6.0` guard).

3. **3 cycles lost ArticleNet training to lock exhaustion** —
   `inject err: database is locked` after the `_LOCK_RETRY_SLEEPS =
   (3.0, 8.0, 15.0)` retries exhausted. ArticleNet was retrained on
   the previous cycle's data those cycles. Not a bug (the retry +
   backoff is correctly tuned) — a heads-up for the operator that
   under heavy host saturation the inject step IS the bottleneck.

4. **Recent (last 2000) OOS forward-return-5d distribution is calmer
   than the documented ~σ=11.7 baseline:** `μ=+0.84, σ=6.13,
   p1=-15.56, p99=+18.69, |fr|>50: 0, |fr|>30: 3`. The Phase-1
   label-clamp fix is essentially a no-op on this slice (only 3/2000
   rows >30%, none >50%), but it's still correct for older tail
   data (the docs cite 25/5000 above 50% in earlier cycles).

5. **`oos_bootstrap_ci` on the full accumulated outcomes file
   surfaces real edge:** `rank_ic = +0.2245 [+0.171, +0.287]` —
   CI cleanly excludes 0. This is materially higher than the
   per-cycle `oos_ic` of 0.02–0.11 the skill ledger reports
   because the per-cycle view runs on smaller temporal slices
   (~1000 rows from one window). The full-file accumulated view
   shows the scorer's directional edge IS real over the broader
   corpus — even though magnitude RMSE remains above σ. A
   skeptical quant can now read this as a single line with a
   statistically defensible verdict.

### Constraints honoured

- **Invariant #5** (gate at `n_train ≥ 500`) — unchanged. The CI
  diagnostic is read-only and never modulates the gate.
- **Invariant #10** (single source of truth) — `_spearman` is the
  same `paper_trader.ml.calibration._spearman` every other rank
  diagnostic uses; the label-clamp is `PRED_CLAMP_PCT` from
  `decision_scorer.py`; `_to_float` semantics from the same module.
- **CLAUDE.md §6** — gate arms (`±10/±5/0` buckets, ×0.6 / ×0.85 /
  ×1.15 / ×1.3) untouched; pickle schema untouched; predict() scalar
  contract untouched; `build_features` / `SECTORS` / `N_FEATURES`
  untouched.
- **Concurrent staging discipline** ([[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]])
  — staged ONLY the 4 files I changed (validation.py,
  run_continuous_backtests.py, the two test files) for Phase 1, and
  the 2 new files for Phase 2; concurrent Agent 1 / Agent 4 changes
  to `paper_trader/dashboard.py` and untracked
  `paper_trader/analytics/position_runrate.py` were correctly left
  out of both commits.

## Review pass — paper-trader core hybrid (2026-05-20, Agent 1, ~06:35 UTC) — half-day cadence + signals alias resolution

### Phase 1 — fix: `compute_interval` honored simple weekday/hour rule, not NYSE half-days or full holidays (1 bug)

`paper_trader/analytics/dynamic_interval.py::_is_market_hours` used a flat
9:30–16:00 weekday rule and `_is_session_open_window` only excluded weekends.
On the two known half-days (2026-11-27 day-after-Thanksgiving, 2026-12-24
Christmas Eve, both 13:00 ET close) the runner stayed on the 30-min
MARKET_OPEN cadence for the three hours past the 13:00 early bell — and on
full holidays (MLK, Christmas, etc.) it cycled OPEN-tier (1800s) and could
even fire SESSION_OPEN-tier (300s) cycles on a closed market. Both wasted
Opus capacity against a frozen book (and `market.is_market_open()` correctly
reads False the whole time, so the cadence here disagreed with the gate the
trader's own decision path keys off).

Fix delegates `_is_market_hours` to `market.is_market_open(now_utc)` (the
existing SSOT — handles half-days, holidays, weekends together) and guards
`_is_session_open_window` against `NYSE_HOLIDAYS_2026`. Lazy import inside
both helpers so unrelated test suites that import `compute_interval` don't
pull yfinance through `market.py`; falls back to the pre-fix simple rule on
any market-module import failure (degrade-safe; the hot-path discipline).

### Tests added (4)

`tests/test_dynamic_interval.py`:
- `test_half_day_afternoon_after_early_close_is_closed_cadence` —
  2026-11-27 14:30 ET → 3600s (was 1800s pre-fix).
- `test_half_day_before_early_close_still_open_cadence` —
  2026-11-27 11:00 ET → 1800s (no over-correction).
- `test_full_holiday_uses_closed_cadence` — 2026-12-25 10:00 ET → 3600s.
- `test_holiday_does_not_trigger_session_open_window` — 2026-01-19 (MLK
  Monday) 9:45 ET → 3600s (NOT 300s SESSION_OPEN).

All 8 dynamic-interval tests + 335 nearby tests
(strategy/store/market/half_day/signals/runner_heartbeat/negcache) pass.
Staged only `paper_trader/analytics/dynamic_interval.py` +
`tests/test_dynamic_interval.py` per [[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]]
— concurrent sibling agents had `paper_trader/backtest.py` open with their
own work in flight, correctly left untouched in this commit.

### Phase 2 — feat: company-name → ticker alias resolution in `signals.py`

A headline like `"Nvidia surges to record on chip demand"` historically
extracted **zero tickers** (no `$cashtag`, no ALLCAPS `NVDA` token), so the
article never contributed to `ticker_sentiments(["NVDA"])` counts or to the
per-article `tickers` field Opus reads in the live prompt. Every held name's
news-volume was silently undercounted by every headline that referenced the
company by name rather than by symbol — a real gap in the live prompt the
decision engine reads.

Added `_TICKER_ALIASES: dict[str, tuple[str, ...]]` mapping 19 well-known
companies (NVDA→nvidia, AAPL→apple, MSFT→microsoft, AMZN→amazon,
GOOGL→alphabet, META→facebook, TSLA→tesla, MU→micron, AVGO→broadcom,
QCOM→qualcomm, INTC→intel, MRVL→marvell, TSM→tsmc / taiwan semiconductor,
ASML, AMAT→applied materials, LRCX→lam research, KLAC→kla-tencor,
LITE→lumentum, COIN→coinbase). Each alias matched as a **case-insensitive
whole-word regex** (mirroring `strategy._WORD_TO_TICKER_LIVE_PATTERNS` after
its 2026-05-20 substring-FP fix), so `"applesauce"` / `"pineapple"` do NOT
match AAPL.

Wired through three paths via the new single-source-of-truth `_alias_match`
helper:
- `_extract_tickers` — additive on top of the existing $cashtag + ALLCAPS
  extraction. Every downstream consumer of `signal["tickers"]` benefits
  (the Opus prompt's `tickers=NVDA,...` line, the source-edge attribution,
  etc.).
- `ticker_sentiments` (bulk) — outer loop now `(symbol OR alias)`-matches
  per article; one article hit per ticker per row (no double-counting).
- `get_ticker_sentiment` (single) — same `(symbol OR alias)` semantics.

### Tests added (14)

`tests/test_core_signals.py`:
- `TestTickerAliasExtraction` (9 tests) — `"Nvidia surges"` → `NVDA`;
  `"Apple expands services"` → `AAPL`; `"Tesla cuts prices"` → `TSLA`;
  multi-word `"Taiwan Semiconductor"` → `TSM`; case-insensitive
  (`"nvidia"` / `"Nvidia"` both → NVDA); word-boundary discipline
  (`"applesauce"` / `"pineapple"` → NOT AAPL); no duplication when ticker
  AND alias both present in the same headline; alias pass keeps the
  existing ALLCAPS + `_NOT_TICKERS` filters intact; empty-text contract
  preserved.
- `TestTickerSentimentsAliasPath` (5 tests) — company-name headline
  counts toward ticker `n`; `get_ticker_sentiment` alias path locks
  same behaviour; no double-count when symbol + alias both present;
  unrelated alias does NOT pollute sibling ticker (cross-ticker
  isolation); substring of alias does NOT falsely match in body scan.

73 pre-existing signals tests still pass; 218 across the
signals-related suites (`test_core_signals` +
`test_execute_and_fetch_signals` + `test_signals_lock_degrade` +
`test_signal_followthrough`) clean.

Staged only `paper_trader/signals.py` + `tests/test_core_signals.py`
per [[pt-concurrent-samerole-staging-race]]; concurrent sibling agent had
`paper_trader/backtest.py` modified with their own atomic-write fix in
flight, correctly left untouched (their `a7d93a8` shipped between this
agent's Phase 1 and Phase 3).

### Phase 3 — live validation (~06:35 UTC)

Live runner restarted onto sibling commit `a7d93a8` (the backtest atomic-
write fix) between Phase 2 push and Phase 3 probe. Healthy state:

1. ✅ **`/api/build-info`** `boot_sha == head_sha == a7d93a8`, `stale: false`.
2. ✅ **`/api/portfolio`** $993.93 equity, $40.28 cash, 2 positions, -0.61% vs
   $1000 start, stale_marks=0.
3. ✅ **`/api/runner-heartbeat`** HEALTHY — last decision 3m ago in the
   60m closed-market cadence; `decision_efficacy=PRODUCING` (19/20).
4. ✅ **Discord delivery** — `notify_verdict=HEALTHY`, last_ok 4s before probe.
5. ✅ **Singleton lock** `acquired` (pid=3580806).
6. ✅ **Database** `paper_trader.db` last_updated current (within 3m of
   probe); decisions over last 24h: 43 cycles → 1 fill, 40 hold, 2
   no_decision (4.7% rate; matches `/api/host-guard` empty rate).
7. ⚠️ **Concentration HIGH** — NVDA 66.59% of book + TQQQ 29.35%
   (top3 95.94%). `/api/correlation` confirms SINGLE_NAME_RISK,
   `/api/risk` flags `concentration_severity: HIGH`. Documented in
   the hourly Discord block; not actionable from this pass.
8. ⚠️ **Capital pinned** — 4.05% cash with NVDA earnings ~7h away
   (`/api/briefing` → `Market CLOSED — opens in 7h03m`). The book is
   structurally inelastic to a post-print catalyst. Known
   `capital_paralysis` pathology; already surfaces in Discord.
9. ⚠️ **Host saturation boundary** — `/api/host-guard` `state=CLEAR`,
   `opus_count=4` (this run + 3 sibling concurrent hybrid agents),
   `load_per_cpu=0.72`, `swap_used_pct=77.8%`. The 4-agent concurrent
   review is right at the saturation knee; documented host pathology.

### Counters

`bugs_fixed=1, features_added=1, user_findings=3` (all 3 ⚠ items above
are documented patterns surfaced for awareness; no novel pathology
caught this pass — the value is confirming the live state matches the
documented invariants on a freshly-restarted runner).

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **#10** (single source of truth) — the alias map's matching is centralised
  in `_alias_match`; both extraction and the two sentiment-scan paths consume
  the same helper, so they can never disagree on whether a headline "counts".
- **#2 / #12** (no hard limits, advisory-only) — both Phase 1 (cadence) and
  Phase 2 (alias) are observational/data-sourcing changes; neither modulates
  a trade decision or adds a position cap.

## 2026-05-20 core hybrid pass (Phase 1 fix + Phase 2 feature)

### Phase 1 — fix: 4 missing `@swr_cached` endpoints added to `_swr_prewarm`

Commit `1bcb95f`. `decision-paralysis`, `position-news-cooldown`,
`correlation-cluster-warning`, and `launcher-restart-loop` were
`@swr_cached` but never added to `_swr_prewarm`'s targets list — the same
freeze-triage cold-stall blind spot the
`test_swr_prewarm_coverage.py::test_every_swr_cached_endpoint_is_prewarmed`
invariant exists to catch. A trader opening these panels right after a
restart got `{"warming": true}` instead of real data for one full TTL
cycle. The fix adds the four `(name, handler)` tuples to the prewarm
target list; the test now passes.

### Phase 2 — feature: `/api/buying-power` endpoint

Commit `7e30005`. Surfaces `build_buying_power` (the lean prompt-facing
complement to `capital_paralysis`, already in the Opus decision prompt)
via a new dashboard endpoint, closing the established
prompt→dashboard→Discord trajectory the `buying_power` block has been
following one surface at a time.

Returns: `cash`, `deployed_pct`, `affordable[ticker, price, whole_shares]`,
`cheapest_name` + `cheapest_price`, and the `unlock` candidate
(biggest-loser-first cut priority). Pure single-source-of-truth wrapper
over `build_buying_power` (invariant #10); observational only — never
gates Opus, never caps a trade (#2/#12). SWR-cached 60s with prewarm
registration (test_swr_prewarm_coverage invariant). Scoped to the FULL
WATCHLIST so an operator sees affordability across the universe, not
just the lean `_names_in_play` subset the prompt block trims to.

Tests in `tests/test_buying_power_endpoint.py` pin the
CASH_CONSTRAINED live pathology shape, the DEPLOYABLE whole-share counts
under known mocked prices, the strict `int(cash // px)` floor (999.99 /
500 ⇒ 1 share, never 2), warm-hit cache behaviour, and the prewarm
registration invariant.

### Phase 3 — live validation

Live runner restarted onto commit `7e30005` between Phase 2 push and
Phase 3 probe (git-watcher healthy; `boot_sha == head_sha`). Healthy
state confirmed:

1. ✅ `/api/build-info` `boot_sha == head_sha == 7e30005`, `stale: false`.
2. ✅ `/api/portfolio` $993.93 equity, $40.28 cash, 2 positions
   (NVDA + TQQQ), -0.61% vs $1000 start, `stale_marks=0`.
3. ✅ `/api/runner-heartbeat` HEALTHY — last decision 4m ago in the 60m
   closed-market cadence; `decision_efficacy=PRODUCING` (18/20).
4. ✅ Discord delivery — `notify_verdict=HEALTHY`, last_ok ~5m before probe.
5. ✅ Singleton lock `acquired` (pid=3700750).
6. ✅ `/api/buying-power` (new endpoint) returned a complete affordable
   list with whole-share counts at $40.28 cash against live yfinance
   prices for the full watchlist — feature working end-to-end on the
   live book.

### Counters

`bugs_fixed=1, features_added=1, user_findings=0` (no novel pathology
caught; the value is confirming the live state matches the documented
invariants on a freshly-restarted runner running the new code).

### Invariants reaffirmed by this pass

- **#10** (single source of truth) — `/api/buying-power` is a pure
  formatter over `build_buying_power`; cash/deployed_pct/affordable
  computation lives in one builder and feeds both the Opus prompt and
  the new endpoint, so they can never disagree.
- **#2 / #12** (no hard limits, advisory-only) — the new endpoint is
  observational; it surfaces what cash *can* fund, never caps what Opus
  *should* do. The advisory contract follows the `capital_paralysis`
  precedent.
