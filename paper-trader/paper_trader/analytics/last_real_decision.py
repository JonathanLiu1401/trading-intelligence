"""Last-real-decision age — when did the engine last *produce* a decision?

The companion to ``last_fill`` one dimension over. ``last_fill`` answers
"when did the engine last *execute* (FILLED only)?"; this answers "when did
the engine last produce *any real* decision (FILLED / HOLD / BLOCKED)?". The
two surfaces split an actionable diagnostic apart:

  * ``last_fill`` STATIC + this FRESH → engine is producing HOLD decisions
    (intentional sit-out — healthy). The Discord operator on a pager sees
    "engine deciding to wait", not "engine wedged".
  * ``last_fill`` STATIC + this STALE → engine is producing only
    NO_DECISION rows (claude wedge / quota / host-saturation). The IDLE_STORM
    smoking gun: the loop is cycling (the decisions table grows) but real
    decisions are NOT, and the trader needs to either bounce the runner or
    wait out the quota.

The dashboard endpoint ``/api/last-real-decision`` already exposes this
verdict, but it never reaches the Discord operator — who lives in Discord
and never opens the dashboard panel (the documented dashboard→Discord gap
``_capital_pulse_line`` / ``_host_pulse_line`` / ``_last_fill_line`` each
closed one dimension over). This builder is the SSOT both surfaces consume
so the Discord line and the endpoint can never drift on the same row.

Pure & offline (the ``last_fill`` precedent): the caller owns the
``store.last_real_decision()`` read and the wall clock. Cadence multiples
mirror ``analytics.runner_heartbeat`` — re-imported here would create a
cycle hazard if the heartbeat module ever grows store-touching imports, so
this leaf re-declares the constants. They must STAY in lockstep with
``runner_heartbeat`` (a future divergence would be the bug); a tiny
regression test pins the equality.

Same advisory-only invariant: a verdict on the decisions table, no caps,
no gating, no path to ``_execute`` (AGENTS.md invariants #2/#12 — the
``last_fill`` precedent).

**Verdict ladder** (advisory only, never gates):

  * ``NEVER``       — ``last_real_decision()`` returned ``None`` (a
    fresh-boot book whose first 24h was all NO_DECISION storms; the engine
    has never produced a real decision). The hourly surfaces this — the
    book is alive but has decided nothing.
  * ``FRESH``       — gap ≤ ``LAGGING_MULT`` × expected cadence. Engine is
    deciding normally. The hourly suppresses this.
  * ``DELAYED``     — gap between ``LAGGING_MULT`` and ``STALLED_MULT`` ×
    expected. The engine has decided recently but slower than normal. The
    hourly suppresses this — a quiet hour is not actionable yet.
  * ``STALE``       — gap > ``STALLED_MULT`` × expected. The actionable
    "engine cycling but not producing real decisions" wedge — the hourly
    surfaces this.

Never raises — an unparseable timestamp degrades to ``STALE`` (the dashboard
endpoint precedent: the row clearly exists but we cannot say *when*, so the
operator-safe verdict is "treat as wedged" — false-negative-protective).
