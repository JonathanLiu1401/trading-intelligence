"""Runner heartbeat — is the trading loop itself alive?

Every other diagnostic on the desk (``decision_health``/``-forensics``/
``-drought``/``-reliability``, ``feed_health``, ``build-info``) reasons over
rows that *exist* in ``decisions`` (or over a code SHA / article age). None
close a verdict on ``now - max(decisions.timestamp)`` vs the runner's
expected cadence — so a dead or wedged ``paper_trader.runner`` is invisible:
``decision_drought``'s ongoing drought freezes its ``duration_hours`` the
instant rows stop appearing, ``feed_health.blind_streak`` cannot grow without
new rows, and ``build-info.stale`` only catches a stale *code* SHA. This
detector closes that gap.

Pure & offline: the builder takes ``last_decision_ts`` / ``market_open`` /
``now``; the endpoint owns the ``store.recent_decisions(1)`` read and the
``market.is_market_open()`` / wall-clock calls (the ``thesis_drift``
"network in the endpoint, builder takes the dicts" split).

The module **owns** its cadence constants (the ``feed_health.STALE_HOURS``
precedent — the module is the spec; the test reads these constants so a
retune cannot false-fail it). They mirror ``runner.OPEN_INTERVAL_S`` /
``runner.CLOSED_INTERVAL_S``; deliberately not imported from ``runner`` to
keep this leaf pure and free of any import cycle.

**Decision efficacy (additive, 2026-05-18).** Cadence liveness alone is a
*dangerous half-truth*: a loop that cycles perfectly on schedule but emits
``NO_DECISION`` every cycle (the documented live regime — ~60% lifetime,
runs of 5+ back-to-back under host-load timeout storms) reports a flat green
``HEALTHY … restart_recommended:false``. An operator/trader reading the
heartbeat — its primary purpose — is then *actively* reassured the engine is
fine while it is brain-dead. ``decision_health``/``-forensics`` analyse the
NO_DECISION rate, but a trader checks the *heartbeat* first for "is anything
wrong". When ``recent_actions`` is supplied (newest-first
``decisions.action_taken`` strings) the builder computes an additive
``decision_efficacy`` sub-block and, **only** on a genuine idle-storm
(``>= NO_DECISION_STORM_THRESHOLD`` consecutive NO_DECISION — the same wedge
``runner``'s auto-recovery circuit breaker targets), folds that into the
top-level ``headline`` + ``restart_recommended`` so the green light can no
longer hide a stuck engine. The liveness ``verdict`` enum is left untouched
(the documented liveness/efficacy separation; every verdict-string lock
stays green). With ``recent_actions`` omitted the output is byte-identical
to before.

**Advisory only.** It states a fact about loop liveness; it issues no
directive, imposes no cap, and has no path to ``_execute()``. It does *not*
violate "no hard risk limits / Opus has full autonomy" (AGENTS.md
invariants #2/#12) — that governs *gating* decisions, not *observing the
loop*; same reasoning as ``feed_health`` / ``self_review``. A mirror, not a
cage. Never raises — an unparseable timestamp degrades to ``NO_DATA``.
