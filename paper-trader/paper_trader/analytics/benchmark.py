"""S&P 500 buy-and-hold benchmark — the single "is this bot worth running
versus just buying the index and doing nothing?" KPI.

Every trader's first question about an automated strategy is *not* "what is
my Sharpe" — it is "would I have more money if I'd just bought the index?".
This stack records ``sp500_price`` on **every** ``equity_curve`` write from
cycle one, so the answer is a pure arithmetic walk of one table — but until
now nothing computed it.

NOTE the figure is the ``^GSPC`` *index level* (~7400), **not** the SPY ETF
share price (~620). This module therefore says "S&P 500" / ``sp500`` /
``index`` everywhere and never "SPY" — a panel that mixes a 7400 mark with a
"$620 SPY" label loses the trader's trust. The buy-and-hold arithmetic
(notional capital × index ratio) is identical either way.

Why this is **not** a duplicate of an existing panel — do not "consolidate"
these; invariant #10 forbids re-derivation and they measure different things:

* ``/api/open-attribution`` (``open_attribution.py``) is per-**open**-
  position alpha *since each lot's entry* — blind to realised P&L and cash
  drag, and it resets its window every time a lot is re-opened (invariant
  #8). It answers "are my *current* picks beating the index since I bought
  them", not "is the *account* ahead".
* ``/api/analytics`` ``sp500_beta`` / ``sp500_correlation`` is a *statistical*
  regression needing many daily points (``null`` on the live book right
  now). It answers "how market-correlated am I", not "am I ahead in dollars".
* This is the **whole-account** number: cash + open positions + every
  realised round-trip + every unrealised mark, since the first equity write,
  versus the identical starting capital invested once in the S&P 500 at that
  same instant and held untouched. Defined from cycle 1 — no regression, no
  per-lot windowing.

Advisory only — it reports, never gates Opus, adds no caps (paper-trader
AGENTS.md invariants #2/#12; the ``self_review``/``desk_pulse``
observational precedent). Pure & network-free: a walk of the ``equity_curve``
rows the caller already read (the ``drawdown.py`` "network in the endpoint,
builder takes the dicts" split), so the core is offline & deterministically
testable. Never raises — a malformed row degrades; the contract is "no
benchmark this cycle", never an exception.
